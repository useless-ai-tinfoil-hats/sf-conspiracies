    Given the following input with a conspiracy title, description, and sources, create a highly 
    detailed and vivid scene that can be passed into an AI image generator based on the title and description.
    The scene should include specific visual elements, actions, 
    setting, and mood that reflect the core theme of the conspiracy theory. The prompt should be 
    structured for optimal image generation.

    **Conspiracy Theory Description**:
    {{input}}

    **Requirements**:
    1. **Setting**: Where is the scene taking place? Provide a vivid description of the location, time of day, weather, or other environmental factors.
    2. **Main Characters/Objects**: In one sentence, describe what or who is in the scene? Include any important figures, objects, or entities (e.g., UFOs, secret agents, strange artifacts).
    3. **Key Actions**: What is happening? Describe any movements, interactions, or behaviors.
    4. **Atmosphere and Mood**: Set the tone of the image (e.g., eerie, mysterious, futuristic) in one sentence.

    **Example Output**:
    A futuristic night-time scene in San Francisco, with a large UFO hovering silently above the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is dimly lit by streetlights, casting long shadows on the road. Dark clouds swirl ominously in the sky, as the UFO emits a faint, eerie blue glow. Below, several shadowy figures dressed in black suits and sunglasses are standing near the base of the bridge, staring upwards. The city in the background is barely visible through a thick, fog-like mist. The atmosphere is tense, with cool tones dominating the scene. The lighting is dramatic, with sharp contrasts between light and dark areas.

    Now generate a similar prompt based on the given conspiracy theory.
