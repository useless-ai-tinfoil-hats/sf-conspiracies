Giants’ spending spree ends with Blake Snell, a Boras trio and busted narratives
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Scott Boras is an agent who does things purposefully. There's little doubt that when three of his highest-profile free agents wind up in one spot, he likes the way things are going with that team.Since December, the San Francisco Giants have signed Boras clients Jung Hoo Lee, the team's new leadoff man; Platinum Glove third baseman Matt Chapman; and, this week, Cy Young winner Blake Snell.
That's no easy feat when dealing with the sport's most powerful agent.
