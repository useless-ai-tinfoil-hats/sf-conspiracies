Major BART delays after train derails, catches fire
-----
LATEST 7:21 p.m. BART said it's working towards towing train cars after one partially derailed earlier this morning, according to a post on X. While crews are still repairing damaged sections of the track, the agency announced that partial service could return by Tuesday."As of 7:10 p.m. we are hopeful to have at minimum, single tracking train service through the area on the Yellow line for morning service. It could be full normal service depending on progress made," BART wrote on X.
