Brandon Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel kick off 49ers-Browns pregame scuffle
-----
The San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns had to be separated after the teams got into a kerfuffle ahead of Sunday's game.It's not exactly clear how the tension between the two sides got started. Videos from the Browns' stadium press box show the two sides already gathered and close to one another, as if each group was already preparing for a confrontation.
While Brandon Aiyuk was in the face of some Browns players clapping, it was Deebo Samuel that seemed to pop things off.
