Rhiannon Giddens sets up a multifront musical whirlwind for Bay Area audiences
-----
The pace and scope of Rhiannon Giddens' artistic activity can seem hard to fathom until you get her into conversation. Then the whirlwind that's about to hit the Bay Area begins to make a little more sense.Giddens is a fast talker, her remarks packed with ideas and inventions and probing theories that come tumbling forth as quickly as she can formulate them. There's a bubbling curiosity at work, which seems determined to seek every outlet it can find.
