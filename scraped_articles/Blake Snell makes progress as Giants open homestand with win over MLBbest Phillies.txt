Blake Snell makes progress as Giants open homestand with win over MLB-best Phillies
-----
Blake Snell's fifth start with the San Francisco Giants was much better than any of his previous ones.His curveball had bite, his four-seam fastball had life and his slider, typically a pitch that doesn't form until later in the season, emerged as he struck out a season-high sevens. But the Philadelphia Phillies, boasting one of baseball's best lineups, erased the Giants' early three-run lead by tacking four runs on him against him and ticked his pitch count up to a season-high 90.
