Bay Area donors say they want Biden to stick it out after replacement chatter
-----
I checked in with a top California donor the morning after President Joe Biden's debate debacle to ask whether they had a minute to chat."If I sober up," the donor quipped.
It's been that kind of 24 hours for Democratic fundraisers in California and those close to Biden in the state where his campaign received 22% of the money ($305 million) he raised in 2020. Many were up into the wee hours of Friday morning, talking donors, officeholders and party operatives off the ledge.
