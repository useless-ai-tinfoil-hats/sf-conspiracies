ESPN talking heads accuse one another of not being sober while arguing over 49ers
-----
It sure seems like nobody in the national media is capable of being normal when talking about the San Francisco 49ers.While not exactly the best example of normalcy, the talking heads on ESPN's "First Take" continued this trend on Wednesday's episode. This instance all began on Monday when Stephen A. Smith argued that the 49ers would lose to the Lions in Sunday's NFC championship game if star wideout Deebo Samuel couldn't play because of his shoulder injury.
