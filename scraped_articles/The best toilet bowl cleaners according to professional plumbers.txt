Which, like many things in life, will just make it that much harder to deal with when you do finally get around to it â€” not to mention that a dirty bowl can be unhealthy for you and those you live with."There are many toilet cleaners on the market," said Tatiana Klien, CEO of Anta Plumbing in Toronto, Ontario. "So what you use depends a lot on how you feel about chemicals."
