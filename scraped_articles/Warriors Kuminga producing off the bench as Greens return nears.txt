Warriors’ Kuminga producing off the bench as Green’s return nears
-----
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — As the Golden State Warriors prepare for Draymond Green's return Monday in Memphis, it's worth checking in on the man who replaced him in the starting lineup for most of the past month.Jonathan Kuminga made 14 consecutive starts at power forward after Green disappeared on his latest suspension. Then, on Friday night in Chicago, head coach Steve Kerr juggled his lineup once more, sending Kuminga back to the bench and starting Dario Saric in a search for size and spacing.
