S.F.'s brief heat wave is ending, making way for more foggy weather
-----
San Francisco is finally showing signs of summer heat as the month draws to a close. Tuesday marked the second consecutive day that parts of the city's east side reached the low 80s. This briefly narrowed the typical temperature gap with the traditionally warmer interior areas of the East and North Bay, where temperatures peaked in the mid-90s on Tuesday.But you just need to look toward the ocean to see what's coming for the city, and eventually for the entire region.
