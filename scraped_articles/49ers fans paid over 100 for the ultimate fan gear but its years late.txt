49ers fans paid over $100 for the ultimate fan gear but it's years late
-----
Thousands of 49ers superfans want to display their fandom to their team so much, they're willing to put their team's logo on a license plate. The only problem is that the California State Parks-sponsored program they paid into is not even halfway to reaching its goal before its deadline in the spring.But cheer up, 49ers fans, because y'all still did better than another California NFL team that went DOA in a similar program.
In a union that few saw coming, the 49ers Foundation
