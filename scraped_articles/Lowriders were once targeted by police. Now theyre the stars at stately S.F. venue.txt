Lowriders were once targeted by police. Now theyâ€™re the stars at stately S.F. venue

Four decades ago, Roberto Hernandez never imagined lowriders at the Palace of Fine Arts.The founder of the San Francisco Lowrider Council remembers a time when people got harassed by police and arrested for lowriding, which people once associated with drug dealing because they assumed that's how riders got the money for their cars, he said.
"It wasn't that at all," he said. "I was working side jobs all the time just to get enough money to get that next accessory for the car."
