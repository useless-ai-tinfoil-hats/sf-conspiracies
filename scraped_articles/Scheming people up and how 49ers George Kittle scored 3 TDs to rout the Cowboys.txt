‘Scheming people up’ and how 49ers’ George Kittle scored 3 TDs to rout the Cowboys
-----
After George Kittle scored three touchdowns in Sunday night's 42-10 demolition of the Dallas Cowboys, the San Francisco 49ers' tight end smiled when asked about the last time he'd been in the end zone so often.It hadn't happened in the All-Pro's previous 86 NFL games. And it didn't happen at Iowa, nor at Norman (Okla.) High School. But it did happen — a lot, he said — when he was in seventh grade and played running back for the Northwest Junior High Vikings in Iowa City, Iowa.
