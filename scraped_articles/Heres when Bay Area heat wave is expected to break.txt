Hereâ€™s when Bay Area heat wave is expected to break
-----
The heat wave is set to finally break this weekend, but it will take time for the cool air to spread to the entire Bay Area.The National Weather Service's heat advisories for the Bay Area continue through Saturday evening. Hot and dry winds will once again strip away the region's natural AC unit, leading to more rounds of unusually hot weather that will disproportionately impact communities along the bay until temperatures fall closer to average by the end of the week.
