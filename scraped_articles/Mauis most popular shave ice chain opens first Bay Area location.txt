Maui's most popular shave ice chain opens first Bay Area location
-----
A popular shave ice chain from Maui, Ululani's Hawaiian Shave Ice, plans to open its first Bay Area franchise on Saturday in Livermore.Franchise owner Monica Shiu, a Livermore resident who is opening the shop with her husband Allen Shiu, first fell in love with Ululani's on a trip to Maui during a difficult time in her life. In 2021, her mother died, and she also found out her father had cancer.
"I really felt defeated and it put me in a really numb, dark spot," Shiu told SFGATE.
