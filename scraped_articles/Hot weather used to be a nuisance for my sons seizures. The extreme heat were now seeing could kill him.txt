Hot weather used to be a nuisance for my son’s seizures. The extreme heat we’re now seeing could kill him
-----
When I moved back to the east coast from Santa Clara in 2005, I said goodbye to a lot of things — including temperate weather. The D.C./Virginia area welcomed me home with hot sticky summers that made my daily runs less enjoyable again and gave me sweat stains on my morning commutes to the office. It was a nuisance.Nowadays, though, I long for a time when hot days were nothing more than that — a minor inconvenience — instead of the life-threatening occurrences they've become.
