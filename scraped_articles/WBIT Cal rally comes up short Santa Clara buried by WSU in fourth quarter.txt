WBIT: Cal rally comes up short; Santa Clara buried by WSU in fourth quarter
-----
Cal pulled to within a point three times in the final minute, but Marta Suarez missed a would-be game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer as the Bears lost 63-61 to St. Joseph's in a second-round WBIT game at Haas Pavilion on Sunday."We're sad to see it come to an end," said coach Charmin Smith. "I thought St. Joseph was really aggressive, very active. They played well and did enough to rattle us."
The Bears (19-15) trailed 58-48 with 2:54 to play before going on a 9-0 run.
