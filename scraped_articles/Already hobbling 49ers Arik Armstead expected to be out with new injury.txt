Already hobbling, 49ersâ€™ Arik Armstead expected to be out with new injury
-----
San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Arik Armstead could miss more than one game with a knee injury he suffered in a 42-19 win over the Eagles on Sunday, head coach Kyle Shanahan said.Shanahan didn't officially rule Armstead out of Sunday's game against the Seahawks at Levi's Stadium, but he acknowledged it was unlikely he would be available.
"I'd be surprised if he was ready this week," Shanahan said. "Still haven't ruled him out yet. But it might be a week or two."
