Official book bans are dangerous but soft book bans are worse
-----
The bans began before my books were even published.At a teacher's convention in the Midwest last fall, educators told me they might lose their jobs and their pensions if they included my two forthcoming books in their class libraries. My debut picture book, "The ABCs of Queer History," and my debut young adult novel, "Unbecoming," were likely to fall afoul of new state laws, they said. Teachers from a number of states have since said the same.
That's the thing about the book bans
