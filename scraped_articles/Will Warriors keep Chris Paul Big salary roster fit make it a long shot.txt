Will Warriors keep Chris Paul? Big salary, roster fit make it a long shot
-----
Admit it, you're going to miss Chris Paul.The Golden State Warriors' most annoying villain for the past decade-plus, or at least co-MAV with LeBron James, joined the team this season, and it probably was a one-and-done. He'll likely move on down the NBA road, but not without regrets, both ways.
Paul is not the only player who is iffy to return. Nobody's guaranteed. Well, Joe Lacob probably will be back as team owner, and Steve Kerr seems likely to be the head coach for season No.
