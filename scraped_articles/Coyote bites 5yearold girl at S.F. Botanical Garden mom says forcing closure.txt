Coyote bites 5-year-old girl at S.F. Botanical Garden, mom says, forcing closure
-----
A coyote bit a girl in the San Francisco Botanical Garden on Friday, forcing park officials to close the garden due to what they said was "coyote activity."The 5-year-old girl was playing in the garden during a supervised summer camp around 11:15 a.m. Friday when the coyote approached her from behind and bit her, said her mother, Helen Sparrow, in an interview Sunday evening.
"She started to run, she tripped and it bit her on the bum when she was down," Sparrow said.
