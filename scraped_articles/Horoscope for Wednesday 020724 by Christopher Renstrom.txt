Horoscope for Wednesday, 02/07/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): The more you try to press for specifics, the more evasive the other person becomes. This does not bode well for trust and honesty. You need to get to the bottom of things ASAP.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Your idea of what sells is hobbling your creativity. Tune out what you think people want and heed your own natural impulses. You can't go wrong.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Do you really need to collaborate on a project where you don't get any credit?
