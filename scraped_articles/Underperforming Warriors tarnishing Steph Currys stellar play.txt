Underperforming Warriors tarnishing Steph Curry's stellar play
-----
Stephen Curry is a losing player. At least, that's what advanced analytics suggest.According to NBA.com, the Golden State Warriors have been outscored by 5.6 more points per 100 possessions with Curry on the floor this season than with him off it. This statistical anomaly makes little sense â€” that is, until one sees the four teammates behind him in differential: Kevon Looney (minus-5.8), Klay Thompson (minus-5.8), Draymond Green (minuts-8.6) and Andrew Wiggins (minus-16.4).
