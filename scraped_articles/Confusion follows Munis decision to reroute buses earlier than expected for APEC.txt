Confusion follows Muniâ€™s decision to reroute buses earlier than expected for APEC
-----
Muni buses began rerouting service Friday ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, a move that San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency officials originally said wouldn't happen until Monday."Muni is no longer able to serve stops in exclusion zones," SFMTA said on social media. "Muni service is passing blocked stops. For safety, riders should not stand in the street as Muni buses will not stop. Conditions are changing rapidly due to street impacts."
