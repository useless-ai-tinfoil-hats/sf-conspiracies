Treasured Bay Area hiking landmark repaired after vandalism
-----
A popular Bay Area hiking landmark has been repaired after being vandalized last month, according to a social media update.The pole sculpture that sits about 200 feet from Mission Peak's 2,516-foot summit was returned to its original place Tuesday, officials from the Mission Peak Regional Preserve said in the social media post.
The Mission Peak pole can be found at the end of a steep 3.1-mile hike in the East Bay. Accomplished hikers typically pose by it for a victory photo.
