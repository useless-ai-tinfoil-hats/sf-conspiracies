Sonoma loves its farms. Activists call them factories. Could a ballot measure upend this county?

In dimly lit indoor aisles at Weber Family Farms in Petaluma, hundreds of thousands of white chickens live out their 90 weeks of life. They fly from perch to perch. They dust bathe in the bedding. They nip at water dispensers. They lay egg after egg.And they never leave.
These barns are at the heart of a bitter fight that Mike Weber and Samantha Faye are waging for the future of local farming.
To Weber, the fourth-generation steward of the farm, these birds are his heritage.
