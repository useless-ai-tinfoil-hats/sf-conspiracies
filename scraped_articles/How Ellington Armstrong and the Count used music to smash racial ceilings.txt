How Ellington, Armstrong and the Count used music to smash racial ceilings
-----
You likely know their names: Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and William James "Count" Basie. And you probably think you know their stories.Ellington is the man who seduced the country with "Mood Indigo" and 6,000 other tunes composed on his Steinway Grand, and who wound up on a U.S. coin and a U.S. postage stamp.
