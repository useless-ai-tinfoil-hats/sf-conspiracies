Help them out and you help yourself too.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You stepped on a number of people's toes lately so come bearing gifts. It will make a lot of sore losers feel less sore.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You could go far on your own steam, however you could go even further by letting a mentor show you how to hone your skills.
