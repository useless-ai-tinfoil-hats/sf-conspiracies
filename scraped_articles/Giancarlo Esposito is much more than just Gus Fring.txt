Giancarlo Esposito is much more than just Gus Fring
-----
The next time you're watching a movie, or a TV show, or even a home video of you and your family, I want you to ask yourself a series of questions:Am I watching something that has Giancarlo Esposito in it? Is there a chance he might appear in this film later on, perhaps in an unannounced cameo? If Giancarlo Esposito isn't in this movie, why not? How can we carve out a solid role so that we can ensure Giancarlo Esposito will be a part of it?
If you have no idea who I'm talking
