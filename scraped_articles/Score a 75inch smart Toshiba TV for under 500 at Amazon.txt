Score a 75-inch smart Toshiba TV for under $500 at Amazon
-----
Back in the day, I remember getting my first 42-inch TV and thinking it was something special, but now, you can go much bigger without breaking the bank. For example, with this deal from Amazon, you can pick up a Toshiba 75" C350 Series LED 4K Smart Fire TV for only $499.99 and save $300.Toshiba 75" C350 Series 4K UHD Smart Fire TV - $499.99 ($300.00 off; originally $799.99)
At 75 inches, this bad boy is over 6 feet diagonally, so it's like having a movie theater in your own house.
