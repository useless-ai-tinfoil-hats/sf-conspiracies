Three city rituals every San Franciscan should do at least once
-----
There are three things every San Franciscan should do at least once: Walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, get up before dawn on April 18 to go to Lotta's Fountain to commemorate the 1906 earthquake, and sneak out of work early on a weekday afternoon to go to a Giants game.They are rituals of spring, and each has rituals of their own. On Wednesday, I tried the ballgame.
April baseball is a bit like April love: everything is new, everything is promising. You can't wait to get started.
