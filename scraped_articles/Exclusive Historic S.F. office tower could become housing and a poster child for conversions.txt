Exclusive: Historic S.F. office tower could become housing and a ‘poster child’ for conversions
-----
A local developer is pushing ahead with a plan to convert the historic Humboldt Bank Building in San Francisco's Financial District into apartments, a project officials hope will become a model for how to revive obsolete office buildings to boost the city's struggling downtown.Forge Development said it plans to spend $70 million to acquire and convert the 19-story, 100,000-square-foot tower at 785 Market St. into about 120 apartments.
