’Hallyu’ celebrates K-pop this fall at Asian Art Museum
-----
The 21st century has seen Korean popular culture flood the West. Since the late 1990s, Korean food trends, beauty products, fashion, films like the Oscar-winning "Parasite," television series like "Squid Game" and the global phenomenon that is K-pop music have all become part of the wider lexicon. A new exhibition coming to San Francisco this fall seeks to explain the origins of this movement and immerse museum goers in its trappings."Hallyu! The Korean Wave" is slated to open Sept. 27
