Disneyland security lines are brutal right now
-----
Pack your patience if you're headed to Disneyland: Security lines are particularly rough right now, thanks to a combination of high school grad nights and the start of the summer travel season. With "Fantasmic!" returning Friday night for the first time since the dragon dramatically caught fire in April 2023, it's set to be a busy time at the parks.Over the last week, some Disneyland guests have noticed the wait to get through security screening is dramatically longer than usual.
