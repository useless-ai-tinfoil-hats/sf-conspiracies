How long can Warriors coach Steve Kerrâ€™s latest composition remain a hit?
-----
The Golden State Warriors, in games like Wednesday night's 125-90 romp over the Milwaukee Bucks, are 15 pounds of fun in a 10-pound bag. Too much good stuff. Somehow, it's working.That's going to be the story of the stretch run and into the playoffs. The Warriors have too many good players playing well, but if they can somehow channel that excess into productivity, they have a chance to make the gamblers and the skeptics look silly.
Of course, it could all blow up in head coach
