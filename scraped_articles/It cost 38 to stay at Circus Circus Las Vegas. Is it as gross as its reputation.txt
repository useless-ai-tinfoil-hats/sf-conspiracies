It cost $38 to stay at Circus Circus Las Vegas. Is it as gross as its reputation?
-----
LAS VEGAS â€” If you Google "Circus Circus," one of the first suggested searches is: "When will Circus Circus be demolished?" Google doesn't tell us whether this is being searched by people contemplating the ever-changing nature of Las Vegas or by guests walking in real-time through the big top-themed casino. But after about 10 minutes inside Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, searching for my $38 room, I start to think it's the latter.Of all the fever dreams in Las Vegas, few are as delirious
