Gavin Newsom wants California to impose tougher penalties for 'tranq' dealers
-----
SACRAMENTO â€” Gavin Newsom continued his tough-on-crime approach to the overdose crisis on Tuesday by proposing a ban on xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer popularized as a street drug under the name "tranq."The Democratic governor called on state lawmakers to increase criminal penalties for dealing the drug, which is increasingly being used by people and is often mixed with the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Veterinarians would still be able to prescribe the drug for animals.
