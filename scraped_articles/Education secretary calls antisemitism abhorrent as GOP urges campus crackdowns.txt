Education secretary calls antisemitism ‘abhorrent’ as GOP urges campus crackdowns
-----
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's education secretary condemned a burgeoning nationwide student movement against Israel's war in Gaza Tuesday before senators, some of whom called for him to strip funding from universities if they don't crack down on antisemitism."What's happening on our campuses is abhorrent. Hate has no place on our campuses, and I'm very concerned with the reports of antisemitism," Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told senators Tuesday.
