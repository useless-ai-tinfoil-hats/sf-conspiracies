Hawaii could ban short-term vacation rentals for good
-----
Two Hawaii bills that will allow counties across the Islands to phase out short-term rentals have been moving through the state legislature. If passed, the counties would have the power to eliminate vacation rentals.The divisive proposals pit short-term investment property owners and online platforms, like Airbnb and VRBO, against housing advocates and hotels, who will benefit from the bills. It would also redefine where travelers can stay when visiting the Islands.
