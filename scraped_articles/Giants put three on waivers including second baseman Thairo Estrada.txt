MILWAUKEE â€” Many players are put on the waiver wire this time of year, and it's not surprising that, according to the Athletic's Ken Rosenthal, the San Francisco Giants have placed relievers Taylor Rogers and Tyler Matzek on waivers.The more interesting player placed on irrevocable waivers is oft-injured second baseman Thairo Estrada. Estrada entered Wednesday batting .216, but has been one of the Giants' better players the past few seasons.
