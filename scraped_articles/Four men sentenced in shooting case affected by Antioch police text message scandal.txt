Four men were sentenced to state prison for terms ranging from 13 to 20 years in a double-shooting case that was compromised because Antioch police officers exchanged racist text messages about the men during the investigation.The men were sentenced last week after pleading no contest to involuntary manslaughter and attempted murder as part of a plea deal. The March 2021 shooting left Arnold Hawkins, 23, dead and another man injured.
