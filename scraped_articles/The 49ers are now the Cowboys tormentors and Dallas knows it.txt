The 49ers are now the Cowboys' tormentors, and Dallas knows it
-----
Sunday's matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers will be the latest chapter in a storied rivalry that spans decades of football history. Yet, for much of that history, the Cowboys often got the last laugh in the postseason, particularly in the 1970s and 1990s.Things have greatly shifted in the current day. While the Cowboys may have the most recent regular season win back in 2020, the Niners have had the pleasure of eliminating Dallas in two straight playoffs.
