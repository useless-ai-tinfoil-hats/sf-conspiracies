Letters: If S.F. can clean its streets for APEC, why canâ€™t city do it all the time?
-----
San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Gov. Gavin Newsom have set a dangerous precedent by showing that they can clean and beautify our city for a special occasion like this week's APEC meeting.Now we wonder why they do not seem to be able to do their jobs of keeping San Francisco in functioning shape the rest of the time.
Newsom opined that we clean our houses for special visitors. Fair enough, but it would be nice to clean our house for residents and not wait for grand conferences
