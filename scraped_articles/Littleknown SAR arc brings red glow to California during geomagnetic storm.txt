Little-known SAR arc brings red glow to California during geomagnetic storm
-----
The northern lights, or aurora borealis, usually light up skies over the most remote parts of the world such as Iceland and Alaska, but on Sunday night during a geomagnetic storm they appeared farther south than usual, including northern latitudes of the United States and Europe.While there were no reports of the aurora borealis in California, another type of natural light display that can also occur during these storms was captured with a camera.
