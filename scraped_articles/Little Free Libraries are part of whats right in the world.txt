Little Free Libraries are part of whatâ€™s right in the world
-----
Once in a while, humanity has a really great idea like the polio vaccine, hors d'oeuvres or the internet. In that pantheon, I also place the Little Free Library movement.The dollhouse-size structures where people can take and leave books are hard not to like, unless you hate sharing or reading (a bold position). I also appreciate the local color, the different designs and reading materials these posts add to communities. You can learn a lot about your neighbors from the kinds of books
