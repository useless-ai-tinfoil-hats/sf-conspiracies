Savor summer with nectarine and pistachio crumb bars with a hint of star anise
-----
It has been a hot summer, with several days of an unbearable heat wave sweeping the Bay Area. The one thing I am enjoying the most in this sweltering heat is the summer bounty, especially stone fruits. Nectarines have been super juicy and sweet, and I have been bingeing on them by the dozens.These Nectarine, Star Anise and Pistachio Crumb Bars are a perfect anytime summer treat, especially with my morning cuppa masala chai. I got the flavor idea for these bars from my most requested jam
