Peerless in Seattle? 49ersâ€™ Deebo Samuel aims to keep roasting Seahawks
-----
In 2019, San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel, then a rookie, had a 30-yard touchdown run in a 26-21 division-clinching win at Seattle that included a spin move as he pirouetted down the left sideline.Samuel smiled when asked Tuesday where that score would rank among his career's highlight-reel plays.
"That's probably top five, for sure," Samuel said.
The question: Are the other four plays in Samuel's rankings also against the Seahawks?
