A’s pile all of their offense into one inning, but it’s enough to beat Brewers
-----
Oakland A's manager Mark Kotsay frequently talks about fundamental baseball with his team.The A's proved Sunday that sometimes fundamentals are all that's needed, using a four-run fourth inning — which included a bases-loaded walk and two sacrifice flies — to win 4-3 against the Brewers at the Coliseum.
"Those were productive outs," Kotsay said. "We talk about productive outs leading to wins, and that was the result of that fourth inning."
It had otherwise been a quiet week
