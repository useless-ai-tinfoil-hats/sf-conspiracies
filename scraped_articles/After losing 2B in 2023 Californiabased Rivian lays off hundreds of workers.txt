After losing $2B in 2023, California-based Rivian lays off hundreds of workers
-----
Electric truckmaker Rivian is laying off 10% of its salaried staff, the Irvine-based company announced on Wednesday. It's Rivian's third major job cut since July 2022.The 10% layoff round will likely leave several hundred people out of work and slam Rivian's California-based corporate workforce. Rivian spokesperson Harry Porter told SFGATE on Thursday that the company has 16,700 total employees, but added that the thousands of hourly manufacturing workers wouldn't be part of the layoff.
