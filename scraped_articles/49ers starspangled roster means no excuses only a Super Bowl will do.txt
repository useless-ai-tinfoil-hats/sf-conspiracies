49ersâ€™ star-spangled roster means no excuses, only a Super Bowl will do
-----
It's unfair.The sheer volume of elite talent the San Francisco 49ers have crammed onto their roster is eye-popping, so hold onto your eyeballs.
In the annual poll of NFL players rating the league's top 100 players, the 49ers have nine. Seven of those nine 49ers are in the top 30.
There are 32 teams, so every team is statistically entitled to just one player in the top 30, with two teams shut out. In a salary-cap league, to have seven of the top 30 is crazy.
