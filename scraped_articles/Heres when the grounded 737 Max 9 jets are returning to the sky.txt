Boeing 737 Max 9 jets are slated to return to the skies this weekend just weeks after an aircraft operated by Alaska Airlines suffered a blowout mid-flight, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to ground the plane model to undergo rigorous inspections.Both Alaska and United Airlines, the only U.S. airlines that operate the 737 Max 9 aircraft, said Wednesday that they expect some of the jets to be ready for commercial service following the completion of final safety inspections.
