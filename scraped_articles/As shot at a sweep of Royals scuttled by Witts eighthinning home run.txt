A's shot at a sweep of Royals scuttled by Witt's eighth-inning home run
-----
Looking to complete a three-game sweep of the Royals on Thursday afternoon at the Coliseum, the Oakland Athletics instead got a glimpse of why Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. ranks as one of the major's most electric young players.The 24-year-old opened the eighth inning by blasting a Vinny Nittoli pitch into the left-field stands. Witt, who leads the AL with a .322 batting average, gave the Royals a 3-2 lead with his 12th homer of the season. K.C. prevailed by that 3-2 margin.
