Bay FC not yet at full strength, but approach takes shape during preseason
-----
Bay FC was shorthanded in its first two NWSL preseason games, but the outings provided the first chance to showcase the type of soccer the expansion team wants to play.Head coach Albertin Montoya confirmed Tuesday that Bay FC will start with a 4-3-3 formation for most matches, but that as things evolve, that will change throughout each game. As it is, the team — which played to a scoreless draw with Angel City and lost 2-1 to San Diego — has yet to practice with a full roster.
