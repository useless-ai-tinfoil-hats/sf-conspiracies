If the 49ers win the Super Bowl, where would the victory parade be?

After an impressive second half comeback, the San Francisco 49ers won the NFC championship on Sunday night and are on their way to the Super Bowl, needing just one more win to take home their sixth Lombardi Trophy.While it might seem premature to start thinking about the celebration that would follow if the 49ers were to beat the Kansas City Chiefs and win the whole shebang, there's one big question that Bay Area locals are undoubtedly starting to wonder: Would a victory parade be held
