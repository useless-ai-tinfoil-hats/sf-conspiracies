Sportscaster thrown from RV onto LA freeway, breaking multiple bones
-----
Sportscaster Cordell Patrick told KTLA-TV that he broke multiple bones and dislocated his shoulder after being thrown from an RV in a crash on an LA-area freeway."All I'm thinking about is that I'm going to get hit by a car," said Patrick, speaking from a hospital bed. "I'm on one of the busiest freeways in LA County so what was going through my mind was, 'I'll be dead shortly.'"
KTLA shared video footage, captured by a dashcam, showing Patrick tumbling across state Route 14.
