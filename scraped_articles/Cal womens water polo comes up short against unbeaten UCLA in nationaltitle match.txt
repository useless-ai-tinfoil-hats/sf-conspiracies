Cal women's water polo comes up short against unbeaten UCLA in national-title match
-----
Cal women's water polo team had less than 24 hours to fantasize about winning a national championship in its own pool.The Bears, enjoying their best season since 2018, went on a magical run of holding three of their previous four opponents to season-low goal totals. Everything was seemingly coming together perfectly. Then they ran into a bulldozer.
A Cinderella finish wasn't in the cards Sunday night against undefeated UCLA, which stymied the Cal offense in frustrating fashion.
