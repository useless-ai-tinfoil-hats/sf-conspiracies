A 45-year-old man was arrested in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve on suspicion of firing more than 70 shots from a high-rise balcony near the famed Las Vegas strip, causing over $100,000 in damages to the MGM Grand â€” a flashy resort that offers $1,269-per-person VIP packages and exclusive concert seats to acts like Bruno Mars, KPTV-TV reported. Jon Letzkus could face more than 70 felony charges, according to the Associated Press, and has a posted bail of $500,000, online court records show.
