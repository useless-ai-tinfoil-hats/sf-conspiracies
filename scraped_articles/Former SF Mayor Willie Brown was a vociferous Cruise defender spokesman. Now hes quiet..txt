Former SF Mayor Willie Brown was a vociferous Cruise defender, spokesman. Now he's quiet.
-----
Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown is known for sounding off on political flashpoints and openly talking about, well, anything.Not this time, though.
Brown vociferously defended driverless cars just a few months ago, and once appeared in an ad for Cruise, but he doesn't want to weigh in on the company suspending their nationwide fleet this week amid widespread scrutiny. Reached Friday through a spokesperson, Brown declined to answer a series of questions submitted by SFGATE.
