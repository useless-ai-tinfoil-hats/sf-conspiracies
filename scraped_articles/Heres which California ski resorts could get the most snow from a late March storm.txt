-----
UPDATED FORECAST: California storm to bring thunderstorms, increased flood riskAn unusually cold, dynamic storm is expected to hit California from Friday through Sunday, pushing the freezing level below 5,000 feet at times and blanketing the Sierra Nevada with snow.
While the storm's strength isn't expected to come anywhere near the blizzard earlier this month, 1 to 2 feet of snow is possible, particularly in the Southern Sierra Nevada and the San Bernardino Mountains.
