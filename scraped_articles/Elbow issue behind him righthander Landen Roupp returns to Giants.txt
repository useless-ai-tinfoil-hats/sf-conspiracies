Elbow issue behind him, right-hander Landen Roupp returns to Giants
-----
San Francisco Giants right-hander Landen Roupp still isn't sure exactly how to describe the elbow issue that cost him more than a month.He was told that he had a "capsule sprain," and, he said, "I don't know what that is or if there's even a capsule in your elbow, but that's what they told me."
Roupp said he felt the injury when throwing a curveball in a game with Triple-A Sacramento in May. It again cropped up briefly when he began to rehab, but he's good to go now after five
