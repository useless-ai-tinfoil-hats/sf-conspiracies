A billionaire and his rich friends are waging war against Disney
-----
It's like a storyline from "Succession": an aging businessman worth billions has everything he's ever wanted except the full respect of his peers. In an attempt to cement his legacy, and to place the grandest feather in his cap, he sets his sights on his most ambitious target yet: the biggest entertainment company in the world. He will force his way through the doors. He will conquer the company from the inside. And he will bend it to his will.It sounds like fiction, but it's very real.
