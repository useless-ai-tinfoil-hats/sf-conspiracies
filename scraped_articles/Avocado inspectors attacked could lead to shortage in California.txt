Avocado inspectors attacked, could lead to shortage in California
-----
Be patient with your bag of unripened avocados, because they might become more difficult to find in grocery stores pretty soon.According to a translated June 18 news release from U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar, two United States Department of Agriculture employees were attacked and detained while inspecting avocados in Michoac√°n, "the world's leading producer" of the coveted fruit.
Though the inspectors have since been released, the department is halting avocado and mango inspections
