A small Silicon Valley school district with a significant achievement gap has quietly spent taxpayer dollars on a long list of questionable expenses in recent years — including hiring a Washington, D.C., public relations firm and a Sacramento-based "energy healer" who uses "chakra clearing" while charging nearly $1,200 per session for meditation.District officials defended the spending as necessary for staff wellness and retention.
