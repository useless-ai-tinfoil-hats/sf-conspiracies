Fox News host Sean Hannity is on a mini media tour to promote this week's scheduled debate between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. An unexpected, recurring theme of the media tour has been Hannity's deep respect and admiration for Newsom."From the first time we met we just hit it off and there was a certain relationship that developed that was like, 'Oh, come on, you don't believe all that,'" Hannity told the Los Angeles Times in a piece that published Sunday.
