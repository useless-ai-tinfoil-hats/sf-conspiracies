Tess Boade didn't plan on leaving North Carolina. Initially, she didn't plan on her life in professional soccer at all.If you asked her five years ago, she never would have guessed she would move across the country to continue a career in the NWSL. She was planning on going to medical school.
Then she was drafted, which she hadn't expected. Boade was the last overall pick in 2021 by Gotham, but she elected to take her COVID year at Duke and signed with the North Carolina Courage
