Horoscope for Wednesday, 01/10/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You did everything you could to make someone happy, but still came up short. Move on. They'll realize their mistake one day - and it won't be pretty.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Everything you do has consequences, but if actions come from the right place then being true to yourself means you're also being true to others.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Unfortunately you can't be as generous as you'd like. Don't feel bad. Give what you can. It's more than most
