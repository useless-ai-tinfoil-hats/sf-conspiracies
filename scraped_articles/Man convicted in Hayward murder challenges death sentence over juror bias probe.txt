Man convicted in Hayward murder challenges death sentence over juror bias probe
-----
A man who was sentenced to death for a 1986 murder near BART's Hayward Station has challenged his conviction and sentence because the prosecutor removed both prospective jurors who were Jewish â€” the first case to reach court since revelations that Alameda County prosecutors had regularly removed Jewish and Black jurors from capital cases.Mark Schmeck, now 67, claims he was framed for the murder of Lorin Germaine of Fremont, who was shot inside his mobile home parked outside the station.
