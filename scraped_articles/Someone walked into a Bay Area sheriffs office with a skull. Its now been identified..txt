In February 2001, someone walked into the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office in Santa Rosa holding a human skull.The person told deputies it was found on "Motorcycle Mountain" â€” a local nickname for a forested area off Duncan Road in Monte Rio, around 70 miles north of San Francisco. Sheriff's deputies headed out to the woods, by the Russian River, but found no more remains. The skull had a gunshot wound to the forehead.
