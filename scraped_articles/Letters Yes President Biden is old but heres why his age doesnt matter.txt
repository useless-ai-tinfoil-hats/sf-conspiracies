Letters: Yes, President Biden is old, but here’s why his age doesn’t matter
-----
Regarding "As a neuroscientist, yes, I'm concerned about Biden's mental acuity. Trump's, too" (Open Forum, SFChronice.com, Feb. 29): I found this opinion piece reckless and insulting.The author regurgitates the tired message that President Joe Biden is "too old" for the job without offering evidence that his performance has been impaired by age. While I wish Biden was younger for his own sake, I don't share the author's concern that he isn't up to the job.
Many public officials
