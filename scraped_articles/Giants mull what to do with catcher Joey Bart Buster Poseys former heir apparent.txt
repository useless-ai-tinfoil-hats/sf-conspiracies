Giants mull what to do with catcher Joey Bart, Buster Posey’s former heir apparent
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Joey Bart knows this probably will be his final spring in a San Francisco Giants uniform. One of the organization's more high-profile prospects of the past decade, he's out of options.Patrick Bailey zoomed past Bart on the depth chart last year, leading all big-league catchers in most major defensive metrics as a rookie. Then the team signed eight-year veteran Tom Murphy to be the backup. And utilityman Blake Sabol started 46 games behind the plate last season.
