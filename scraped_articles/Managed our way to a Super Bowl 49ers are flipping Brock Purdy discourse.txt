'Managed our way to a Super Bowl': 49ers are flipping Brock Purdy discourse
-----
Good luck stopping the Brock Purdy discourse now.One week after it seemed a little rain was ruining Purdy's playoff parade, prompting a bunch of takes about how the one-time MVP favorite is actually very bad, the pendulum swung entirely in the opposite direction after Purdy led the 49ers back from down 17 at halftime Sunday to beat the Lions, 34-31, and advance to the Super Bowl.
And yes, Purdy did indeed lead the team, completing 13 of 16 passes in the second half for 174 yards
