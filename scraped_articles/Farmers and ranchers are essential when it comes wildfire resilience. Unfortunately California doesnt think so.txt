Farmers and ranchers are essential when it comes wildfire resilience. Unfortunately, California doesnâ€™t think so

On what should have been a clear, sunny day in Northern California, I squinted with my headlamp into the dark fields of our farm. Each crop shone a dull uniform orange beneath a sky blackened by wildfire smoke. Our masked farm crew moved through the eerie fields, brushing ash from cabbages and cauliflower. Still-legible pages of books fluttered from the sky like snow, and with so little sunlight filtering through, the crops stayed frozen late into the day from the previous night's freeze.
