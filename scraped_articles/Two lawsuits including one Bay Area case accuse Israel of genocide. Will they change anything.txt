Two lawsuits, including one Bay Area case, accuse Israel of genocide. Will they change anything?
-----
Two courts are about to consider lawsuits alleging genocide by Israel in Gaza â€” a Bay Area federal court, in a suit by Palestinian-rights groups against the Biden administration for its support of Israel, and the International Court of Justice, in a suit by South Africa against Israel.But both cases could be undermined for different, though related, reasons: The U.S. government may be legally shielded from a suit over its foreign policy, as it will argue to a federal judge this month.
