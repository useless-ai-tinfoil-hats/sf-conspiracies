Empowered offense key to Stanford softball overcoming last yearâ€™s postseason flaws
-----
Stanford softball's identity might be rooted in its success in the circle, especially by sophomore NiJaree Canady, who has the best ERA in the country.If the Cardinal are to reach the Women's College World Series for the second year in a row and fourth time in school history, they will need continued brilliance on the mound from Canady and perhaps senior Regan Krause. But maybe the biggest difference between this year's team and last year's is a much more prolific offense.
