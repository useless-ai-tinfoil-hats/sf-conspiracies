Stanfordâ€™s Cameron Brink effect is stunning. It also could signal a problem
-----
Stanford is a better team when Cameron Brink is on the floor. That much might sound obvious; she was an All-American last season and is now a projected top WNBA draft pick, national Player of the Year candidate, and probably a shoo-in for another All-America nod.Just how much better Stanford is with her than without is a bit alarming, though. In the Cardinal's first loss of the season, on Dec. 3 at Gonzaga, Brink only played 11 minutes before appearing to ask for a sub due to an illness.
