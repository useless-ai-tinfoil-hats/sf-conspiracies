California home insurance: Should you submit a claim, or will it get you non-renewed?
-----
As insurance nonrenewals and rate hikes pile up in California, many homeowners are wondering: Will paying for repairs out of pocket rather than submitting a claim help avoid being nonrenewed and mitigate higher premiums in the long run?Experts say the answer may be yes, if the cost is small enough. That's because insurers do take the number and cost of previous claims into account when deciding whether to write a new policy, renew the policy or raise their rates.
