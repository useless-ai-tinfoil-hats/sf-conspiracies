Giantsâ€™ Robbie Ray rebounds from rocky outing to stymie White Sox
-----
Robbie Ray had work to do this week.On his mind was one of the worst starts of his career in his last outing. He was pulled two outs into the first inning after hitting two batters, walking three and giving up a Michael Harris grand slam into McCovey Cove in a 13-2 loss to Atlanta on Aug. 14. The San Francisco Giants' left-hander was itching to flush it and get back on the mound, but he needed the week to tweak his delivery and regain control of the strike zone.
Now better squared
