We ranked the best chocolate chip cookies in the Bay Area. This is No. 1
-----
Chocolate chip cookie No. 2 was "bland, dry, ick!" wrote one reviewer. It was also "saccharine," "too soft" and "weirdly fruity," others recorded.The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of judges could not be fooled. In a blind taste test of 23 chocolate chip cookies from bakeries in San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland, the panel put cookie No. 2 in last place.
That's right where it belonged. Unlike the rest of the pack, gathered fresh that day from top bakeries like Tartine and B.
