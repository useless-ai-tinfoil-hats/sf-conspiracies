Can San Ramon Valley's high-powered attack end De La Salle's NCS streak?
-----
The numbers are staggering — 265 and 32 — but not distracting, said San Ramon Valley-Danville football coach Aaron Becker.His Wolves, perhaps the best team in school history and with big numbers of their own, host De La Salle-Concord on Friday night in Northern California's top game of the week.
San Ramon Valley will try to end the last of De La Salle's remarkable decades-long streaks: It has been 32 years and 265 games since the Spartans lost to a North Coast Section opponent.
