A new Old West is rising in the California mountains
-----
For nearly a century, the Hollywood entertainment system has flocked to the Santa Monica Mountains to film movies and television shows. The landscape is so varied, and in places so rugged, that it can easily stand in as a replacement for other locations in the American West, the eastern United States and beyond.In all those years, producers and studios have built quite a bit of infrastructure in the hills, including entire faux Old West towns perfect for re-creating the cowboy aesthetic
