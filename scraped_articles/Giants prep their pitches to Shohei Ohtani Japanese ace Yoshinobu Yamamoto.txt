Giants prep their pitches to Shohei Ohtani, Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto
-----
As the San Francisco Giants' season faded away in the final weeks, their place in the Shohei Ohtani sweepstakes might have evaporated, too.The Giants went 9-19 from Sept. 1 and not only lost all hope for a playoff berth, they also lost their manager when Gabe Kapler was fired before his fourth season on the job was over.
Would Ohtani want to sign with a team that made the playoffs once in seven years? That will transition to a new manager? That has a president of baseball
