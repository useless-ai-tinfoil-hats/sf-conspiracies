Democrats, Biden is the party’s nominee. Stop talking about his age
-----
There's a persistent narrative among beltway pundits and even some well-meaning armchair campaigners that pro-Biden Democrats like me are "in denial" about President Joe Biden's advanced age.But we aren't the ones in denial — everyone else is.
What has become clear as we are dragged through yet another "but Biden's age" news cycle is that we are perhaps the only ones engaging rationally on the issue.
Biden is old; you won't hear me or other pro-Biden Democratic operatives
