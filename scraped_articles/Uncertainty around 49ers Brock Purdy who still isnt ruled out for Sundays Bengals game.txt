Uncertainty around 49ers' Brock Purdy, who still isn't ruled out for Sunday's Bengals game
-----
The questions, uncertainty and intrigue around 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy and his concussion will officially carry through to Sunday, though it seems clear where things will end up.On Friday afternoon, with less than 48 hours until kickoff, Purdy was officially listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Bengals. But even though it'll be less than a week since he was apparently concussed, all signs seem to be pointing to Purdy getting the start on Sunday for the red and gold.
