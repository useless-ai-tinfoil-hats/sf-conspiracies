How to stream Selection Sunday for the men's and women's college basketball tournaments
-----
It's officially the most exciting time of the year for college basketball. Although the games won't tip off until later this week, March Madness essentially starts today as we get to see the brackets. The Selection Sunday specials for the men's and women's college basketball tournaments will air live today on CBS and ESPN, respectively. The men's Selection Sunday show is set to air at 5 p.m. Central/3 p.m. Pacific, while the women's show will kick off right afterwards at 7 p.m. Central/5 p.m.
