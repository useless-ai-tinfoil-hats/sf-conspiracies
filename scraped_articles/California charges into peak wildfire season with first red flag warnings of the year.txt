California charges into peak wildfire season with first red flag warnings of the year
-----
California has seen several spells of hot weather in recent weeks, and the grasses that grew thick and tall in the wet winter are parched and dry. The state is heading into peak wildfire season, no doubt, and state officials are starting to sound the alarm bells, reminding people that the landscape is prone to destructive fires that can trigger mass evacuations."We've recently seen warm and dry conditions," Dalton Behringer, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, told SFGATE.
