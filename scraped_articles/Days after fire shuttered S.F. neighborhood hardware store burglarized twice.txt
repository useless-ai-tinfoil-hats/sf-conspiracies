-----
A San Francisco hardware store was burglarized on back-to-back days less than a week after a fire — which the owner believes was arson — shuttered the shop.Albert Chow, the owner of Great Wall Hardware in the city's Parkside neighborhood, said his store was "ransacked" around 3 a.m. Friday, resulting in a significant loss of high-end inventory. When he returned to the shop Saturday afternoon, he realized he'd been "hit again." The incidents occurred mere days after a fire last Sunday
