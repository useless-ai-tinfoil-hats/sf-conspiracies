California weather: How the jet stream could bring an active storm pattern soon
-----
The wet season is off to a slow start across California, with the state receiving just 54% of normal precipitation in October and November, while early December has followed a similar pattern. Despite a few wet periods in the Bay Area, big storms have remained over the Pacific Northwest, and as a result, Central and Southern California have been much drier than normal.Despite the slow start to the water year, signs point to a more active storm pattern during late December.
