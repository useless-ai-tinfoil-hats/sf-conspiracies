-----
On April 15, Pacific Crest Trail hiker Robert Budinski got dropped off at Black Mountain Road outside of the mountain town of Idyllwild, with plans to hike the road to avoid a notoriously dangerous section of the iconic trail. Then he disappeared.Now, a group focused on finding missing hikers is ramping up search efforts for Budinski (trail name "Ambassador") in what's being considered a "search and recovery" operation due to the months that have passed since he was last seen.
