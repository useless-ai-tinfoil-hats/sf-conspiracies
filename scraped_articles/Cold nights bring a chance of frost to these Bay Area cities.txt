-----
Cold, dry weather returns to California on Wednesday, and it's slated to bring a chance of freezing temperatures and frost to parts of the Bay Area.High pressure will build over Northern California on Wednesday, clearing out the mild and humid air from earlier in the week. Sunny and dry daytime weather will allow temperatures in the afternoon to climb to the mid- and upper 60s across the Bay Area, with a few low 70s possible inland. But temperatures will nosedive after sunset.
