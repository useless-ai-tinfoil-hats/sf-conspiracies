ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Careful what you say. It's true you have the right to express yourself, but others also have the right to interpret that as they see fit.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Does restlessness stem from impatience or frustration? If you don't like the track you're on, then change it. It may be time to think about a new game plan.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Mercury is in Gemini for two weeks. It won't be easy to tell if you're winning or losing but play the hand
