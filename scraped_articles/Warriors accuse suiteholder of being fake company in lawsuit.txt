Warriors accuse suiteholder of being fake company in lawsuit
-----
The Golden State Warriors are suing a San Francisco-based landscaping company, alleging that the company's shareholders owe more than $4 million in rent and hospitality fees for a stadium suite they leased in 2019. According to the suit, filed Wednesday in San Francisco County Superior Court, a local landscaping company is deep in debt on an 11-year lease for a suite at Chase Center, in part because the company is allegedly "a mere shell and sham without capital, assets, stock or stockholders."
