Photos: World’s Ugliest Dogs crowned at Sonoma-Marin Fair
-----
With his "undeniable charm," an 8-year-old Pekingese named Wild Thang won the Sonoma-Marin Fair's annual World's Ugliest Dog contest in Petaluma on Friday.The dog, whose owner, Ann Lewis, is from North Bend, Ore., took home the title — and the $5,000 prize — after entering the contest five times. Wild Thang's long, frizzled brown and white fur and floppy, bright pink tongue that rests comfortably out of the side of his mouth, like a child's sketch of a dog come to life, sealed the deal.
