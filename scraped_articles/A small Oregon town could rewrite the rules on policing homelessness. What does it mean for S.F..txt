A small Oregon town could rewrite the rules on policing homelessness. What does it mean for S.F.?
-----
GRANTS PASS, Ore. — It was moving day, again, for Brenda Daigneault.Police officers in this small city about an hour's drive north of the California border visited her tent in a local park. They came to order her to leave, she said, posting the same notice that every homeless person living in one of Grants Pass' public spaces gets every 72 hours.
If she didn't move in three days, she would get a $295 ticket — and perhaps see her belongings confiscated. Again.
But Daigneault
