-----
Head coach Steve Kerr thought the Golden State Warriors were "frenetic" Friday to start the first quarter of their game against the Dallas Mavericks.A 29-13 deficit speaks for itself.
In came Chris Paul and Golden State's second unit. Off went the Warriors on a 19-2 run.
Kerr this season has a steady second unit upon which he can rely when Stephen Curry and the starters sit. The Warriors chipped away at the deficit Friday with Paul, guards Brandin Podziemski and Gary Payton
