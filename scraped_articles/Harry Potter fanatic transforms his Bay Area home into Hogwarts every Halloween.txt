Halloween is a holiday designed for folks to go a little overboard. If there's any group who knows a thing or seven about going overboard, it's Harry Potter fans, who've powered the books to such popularity that they could be realistically compared with the Bible.Daniel Berson of San Rafael is one such avid Potter fan and every Halloween he transforms his home into Marin's Halloween Hogwarts Walkthrough, a Harry Potter-themed haunted house that is open to anyone and free of charge.
