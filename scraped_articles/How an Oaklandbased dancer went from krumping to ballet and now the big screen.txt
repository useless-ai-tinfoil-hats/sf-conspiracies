How an Oakland-based dancer went from krumping to ballet and now the big screen

"Flower," the new short film co-produced by and starring the world-famous, trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland, opens with an unforgettable scene: A panorama of rippling waters at the Port of Oakland pans to a dock, where a man lies writhing on a platform. As the music finds its pulse, the man seems to levitate on one knee, then rises as if pulled up by the air, snaking his arms, popping his chest, pounding the ground. Finally he slinks away like an apparition of superhuman movement.
