Horoscope for Wednesday, 03/27/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You're ready for a change of scene, but feel like you should time it for after a money matter is settled. Act sooner because peace of mind is worth the financial cost.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Say yes to what's on the table because it's the best offer you'll get. Wait any longer and that number will only decrease.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You may be in the driver's seat, but that doesn't mean you're in charge. You need to work with back seat drivers
