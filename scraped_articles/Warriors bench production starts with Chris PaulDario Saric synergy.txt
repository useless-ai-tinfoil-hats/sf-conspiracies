Warriors’ bench production starts with Chris Paul-Dario Saric synergy
-----
SACRAMENTO — Steve Kerr is restless to see his customary starting lineup find its form, an effort the Golden State Warriors launched Tuesday night with Draymond Green's return from a five-game suspension.But Kerr offers few complaints about his second unit, spearheaded by point guard Chris Paul — assuming Paul doesn't miss much time with the leg injury he sustained against the Kings.
The Warriors' reserves have outscored the opponent's bench by a wide margin this season: 754-555
