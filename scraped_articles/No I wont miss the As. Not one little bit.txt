No, I won’t miss the A’s. Not one little bit
-----
I won't miss the Oakland A's.I won't miss the string of bad owners (with the exception of Walter A. Haas Jr.), starting with Charlie Finley and continuing after Haas with Steve Schott and Ken Hoffman, Lew Wolff and John Fisher and then just … Fisher, who should have done us all a favor and spent his days counting his money and folding jeans at the Gap.
I won't miss Major League Baseball's interference, specifically, former Commissioner Bud Selig blocking the sale to Joe Lacob,
