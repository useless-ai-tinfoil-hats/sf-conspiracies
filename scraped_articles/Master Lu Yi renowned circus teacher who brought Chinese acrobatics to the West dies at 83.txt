Master Lu Yi, renowned circus teacher who brought Chinese acrobatics to the West, dies at 83
-----
The man who transformed circus throughout the world had a classic showbiz origin story.There Lu Yi was, recently arrived to Shanghai with his family of poor farmers, scavenging for cigarette butts that might still have a bit of tobacco left in them to repackage and sell. He didn't look just anywhere, though. He went to an entertainment center called Dashijie, hanging around so persistently that eventually, when he was 11, someone introduced him to the leader of the acrobatics troupe.
