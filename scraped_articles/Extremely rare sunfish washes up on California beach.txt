Extremely rare sunfish washes up on California beach
-----
On Saturday morning, a surfer happened upon an alien-looking sea creature washed up on Kehoe Beach on the Point Reyes National Seashore. It had a nearly 6-foot-long oblong body with a fin popping out on each side, it had no tail, and one of its enormous googly eyes faced upward, seemingly saying hello.Christian Anthony snapped a photo of the specimen and called it a Mola mola in a post on the West Marin Feed, a social media account where he posts news and sightings in West Marin.
