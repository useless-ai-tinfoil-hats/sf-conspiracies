The SF Giants' attempt to ring in the new year went horribly wrong
-----
It seems that festive social media posts in celebration of the new year were not enough to keep the San Francisco Giants away from online fan frustration.The ballclub's account on X, formerly known as Twitter, posted a simple, and likely scheduled, "Happy New Year" graphic with the caption "Happy New Year, #SFGiants fans!" Rather than returning the favor, some fans replied with demands of the organization.
"New year. Same BS offseasonâ€¦" wrote one user, three minutes into 2024.
