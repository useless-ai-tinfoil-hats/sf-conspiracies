Thursday morning, Rize Up Bakery founder and head baker Azikiwee Anderson woke up to over a hundred texts and messages on social media."People were like, 'I was watching the Olympics, and I saw you!'" he told SFGATE.
The San Francisco baker was featured in a Comcast Business commercial for an internet plan for business owners. He's introduced by name ("Z"), is seen baking his eye-catching ube sourdough loaves, and even delivers a line at the end: "That's a lot of bread." Belinda
