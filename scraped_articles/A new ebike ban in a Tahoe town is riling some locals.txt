A new e-bike 'ban' in a Tahoe town is riling some locals
-----
Incline Village, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, has some of the prettiest views around the basin. And thanks to the recently finished East Shore Trail, soon to be extended by another 8 miles, it has some of the best access to east shore beaches and popular Sand Harbor State Park for visitors and residents who prefer to leave their cars at home.But that could change, depending on how police decide to enforce a new Washoe County ordinance some residents are calling an e-bike "ban."
