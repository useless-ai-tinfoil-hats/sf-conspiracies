Zyn nicotine pouches suddenly seem to be everywhere. Are they harmful?
-----
You may have seen Zyn on TikTok, where "Zynfluencers" pop what looks like a piece of white Chiclets gum under their lip. Or perhaps you caught SNL comedian Marcello Hernandez, dressed as a frozen embryo from Alabama, slipping a Zyn into his mouth and quipping, "All the embryos are doing it." Tucker Carlson has said on podcasts that Zyn helps with mental acuity and that he uses one "every minute" he's awake.Zyn suddenly seems to be everywhere, but what is it and why is it so popular?
