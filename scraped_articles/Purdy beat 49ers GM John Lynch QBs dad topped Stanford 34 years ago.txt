Purdy beat 49ers’ GM John Lynch? QB’s dad topped Stanford 34 years ago
-----
Thirty-two years before John Lynch drafted Brock Purdy, he was beaten by the quarterback's dad.The San Francisco 49ers general manager and Shawn Purdy were opponents on April 1, 1990, when Stanford and Miami, both national baseball powers, met at a tournament at the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
Both Lynch and Purdy were pitchers. Lynch didn't throw that day, but Purdy started and threw eight innings, allowing three runs, in a 4-3 Miami win in which he had a no-decision.
