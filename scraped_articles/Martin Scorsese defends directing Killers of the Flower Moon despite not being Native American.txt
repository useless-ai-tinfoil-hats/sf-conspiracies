Martin Scorsese defends directing ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ despite not being Native American
-----
Martin Scorsese has a new film out, and at 80, that makes it a big event. But "Killers of the Flower Moon," in addition to being one of his most epic in scope, could be one of his most controversial films.The 3½-hour movie is based on David Grann's 2017 nonfiction book, "Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI," which investigates the 1920s murders of members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma after oil deposits were discovered on their land.
