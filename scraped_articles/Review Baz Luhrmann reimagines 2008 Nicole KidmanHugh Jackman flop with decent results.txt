Zack Snyder turned his two-hour "Justice League" superhero film into a four-hour "Snyder Cut" for Max. Quentin Tarantino has made his two-hour, 55-minute western "The Hateful Eight" into a four-episode Netflix series, adding close to an hour of material. Ridley Scott says he wants to release his preferred four-hour cut of the two-hour, 38-minute "Napoleon" to a streaming service.Now we have Baz Luhrmann taking another run at his 2008 two-hour, 45-minute box office misfire "Australia."
