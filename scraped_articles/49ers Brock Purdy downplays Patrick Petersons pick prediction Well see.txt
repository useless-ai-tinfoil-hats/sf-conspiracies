Brock Purdy, who was raised in suburban Phoenix, grew up rooting for the Arizona Cardinals and one of his favorite players was All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson.This week, the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback is rooting for Peterson's bold pregame prediction to be unfulfilled in Sunday's regular-season opener at Pittsburgh. On Thursday, Peterson, 33, in his first season with the Steelers, predicted he would intercept a pass from Purdy, 23, because the 49ers have pre-snap giveaways.
