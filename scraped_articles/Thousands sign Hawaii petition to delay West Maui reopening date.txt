Thousands sign Hawaii petition to delay West Maui reopening date
-----
The area of West Maui, where a wildfire swept through the town of Lahaina, is set to reopen Oct. 8, on the two-month anniversary of the Hawaii disaster. Lahaina will remain closed, but some residents say it is too soon to welcome visitors to this side of the island.Hawaii Gov. Josh Green made the reopening announcement earlier this month, stating, "If we support Maui's economy and keep our people employed, they will heal faster and continue to be able to afford to live on Maui."
