Letters: Why Harrison Butkerâ€™s commencement speech is one more reason to stop watching the NFL
-----
Regarding "Why the NFL dumped Colin Kaepernick but won't do squat to Harrison Butker" (Scott Ostler, SFChronicle.com, May 15): I am a 71-year-old lifelong Bay Area resident and sports fan. I was a rabid fan of Tom Flores, Daryl Lamonica, Kenny Stabler, Gene Upshaw and the Oakland Raiders. Then, they abandoned the Bay Area in 1982 and did it again in 2020.Those betrayals combined with the NFL's egregious handling of domestic violence and concussions resulted in my rejection of the NFL.
