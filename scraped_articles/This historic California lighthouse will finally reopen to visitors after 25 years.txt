This historic California lighthouse will finally reopen to visitors after 25 years
-----
Pigeon Point Lighthouse, the historic beacon perched on an outcropping 50 miles south of San Francisco, will reopen to visitors in 2026 following a quarter-century closure.A delightful tourist stopover along Highway 1 between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, the 115-foot-high lighthouse is the centerpiece of a state park. It's tied with the 153-year-old Point Arena Lighthouse for the West Coast's tallest, and has helped mariners steer clear of the rocky coast for more than 150 years.
