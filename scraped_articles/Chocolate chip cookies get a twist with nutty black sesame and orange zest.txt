Chocolate chip cookies get a twist with nutty black sesame and orange zest
-----
December is truly my favorite baking month of the entire year. It means lots of butter, sugar and flour, and the oven is working overtime. I adore coming up with new cookie concoctions in the kitchen and sharing them with friends and family.I love to incorporate the season's bounty into my cookies â€” think Linzer cookies filled with pear jam, orange shortbread sandwiching cranberry buttercream or my Black Sesame-Chocolate Chip Cookies With Orange, which I am sharing today.
