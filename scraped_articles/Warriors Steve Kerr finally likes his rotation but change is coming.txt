Warriorsâ€™ Steve Kerr finally likes his rotation, but change is coming
-----
Finally, after almost eight weeks tinkering with lineups, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr appears to have settled on a rotation.There is just one problem: Kerr will soon have to adjust his substitution patterns yet again. Forward Andrew Wiggins, who has missed the past two games with an undisclosed illness, could return as soon as Monday's Christmas game in Denver. Guard Gary Payton II (strained right calf) is participating in practice, a sign that his return is near.
