Deadpool and the Wolverine made a surprise appearance onstage during Green Day's "Saviors" tour this week.Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong was in the middle of singing "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" during a concert in New York on Monday, Aug. 5, when drummer Tré Cool and bassist Mike Dirnt reentered the stage dressed as the Marvel characters.
The stunt was a nod to "Deadpool & Wolverine," which opened in theaters on July 26, and features the East Bay punk band's 1997 hit.
