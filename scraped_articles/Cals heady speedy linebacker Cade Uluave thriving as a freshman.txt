Calâ€™s heady, speedy linebacker Cade Uluave thriving as a freshman
-----
Like many people, Cal linebacker Cade Uluave made some New Year's resolutions heading into 2023. At the time, Uluave was a senior at Mountain Ridge High School in the suburbs of Salt Lake City."I had a giant paper on my wall," Uluave said last week in a lengthy interview with the Chronicle at Memorial Stadium. Uluave said one of his resolutions was "get on the field as a freshman. That was my main goal."
Unlike many people, Uluave not only reached his goal, he clearly surpassed it.
