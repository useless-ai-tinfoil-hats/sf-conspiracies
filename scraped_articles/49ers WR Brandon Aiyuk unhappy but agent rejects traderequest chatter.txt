49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk unhappy, but agent rejects trade-request chatter
-----
Brandon Aiyuk's offseason contract drama hasn't included a trade request. At least not yet. At least, that is, according to his agent.Ryan Williams, who represents the San Francisco 49ers' All-Pro wide receiver, refuted a report Sunday that his client had asked to be dealt. Wrote Williams on social media to the reporter: "You need better sources."
Of course, the lack of such a request doesn't mean a contract-extension resolution is imminent amid other signs Aiyuk isn't thrilled
