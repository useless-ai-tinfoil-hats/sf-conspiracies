Cove Home Security review: Pros, cons, and pricing
-----
Cove Home Security at a glanceCove Home Security offers customizable home security systems with do-it-yourself (DIY) installation. It stands out for its relatively low-cost 24/7 professional monitoring. It's also relatively low-risk, given that no monthly contract is required, there are no penalties for cancellation, and there is a 60-day free trial. However, if you want to go fully DIY, you'll have to look elsewhere, as Cove doesn't offer a self-monitoring option.
