Make asparagus feel sophisticated with a luxurious butter sauce
-----
A great platter of freshly cooked asparagus is a delightful way to start a meal and also makes a handsome, almost debonair alternative to a leafy salad. This is especially true when those green spears are *just* cooked through, leaving them with a confident crisp-tender texture. (I don't think a floppy spear ever charmed anyone.) Asparagus is also a great way to get a taste of spring with its graceful, grassy sweet flavor.I like to make asparagus feel extra sophisticated by pairing it
