Bay Area car owners have yet another crime to worry about
-----
In addition to car break-ins and swiped catalytic converters, drivers in Northern California have another problem to worry about â€” stolen license plates.In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the Livermore Police Department warned that thieves are stealing license plates and then attaching them to other cars which they then use to commit crimes.
Not only do the stolen plates mislead police investigations, they also can cost their actual owners plenty of money and cause plenty of headaches.
