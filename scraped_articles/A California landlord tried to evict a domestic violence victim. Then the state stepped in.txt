A California landlord tried to evict a domestic violence victim. Then the state stepped in

The manager of multiple apartment complexes had a policy against "disorderly conduct" and used it, according to the state Civil Rights Department, to try to evict a woman who said she was the victim of domestic violence. The department announced a settlement Thursday that forbids such evictions and provides $7,500 to the woman."It is unacceptable for housing providers to punish victims of domestic violence for the actions of their aggressors," Kevin Kish, the department's director, said
