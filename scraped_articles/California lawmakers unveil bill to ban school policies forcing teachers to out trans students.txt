-----
California's LGBTQ legislators unveiled new legislation Wednesday that would outlaw school policies that require teachers and staff to report students who identify as transgender to their parents â€” so-called forced outing policies that have become the subject of fierce legal fights across the state.AB1955 is the latest attempt to block the parental notification policies, which have already been put in place in at least a dozen California school districts, though none are being enforced.
