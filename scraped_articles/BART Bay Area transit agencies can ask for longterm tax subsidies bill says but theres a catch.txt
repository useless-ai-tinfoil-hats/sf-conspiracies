BART, Bay Area transit agencies can ask for long-term tax subsidies, bill says, but thereâ€™s a catch
-----
The Bay Area's transit agencies could get the financial help they're looking for if state lawmakers approve a bill allowing them to place a tax measure for operations on the 2026 ballot.However, the proposal comes with a catch: It would include a study exploring the consolidation of some of the region's 27 transit agencies, something many of the agencies resist, wanting to retain local control.
