Letters: American Jews, this is why Israelâ€™s military must fight to the death
-----
After surviving the Holocaust in Germany, my parents walked back to Poland. They couldn't move back into their home and the Polish people shot at them. There was no Israel for Jews in 1945. They walked back to Germany where I was born.After the United Nations adopted a two-state solution for Palestine in 1948, Palestinians chose war. The only reason Israel still exists is because of the resolve of Israeli Jews to fight to the death.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
