Thieves ransack Bay Area high school football program
-----
Santa Teresa High School-San Jose head football coach Steve Papin was leaving the South Bay high school with his fellow football coaches about 10 p.m. Friday when he noticed a group of men playing basketball on the campus courts. But Papin didn't think anything of it at the time.He sure is thinking about it now, though.
Papin told SFGATE that Santa Teresa was the victim of a theft over the weekend, with two storage containers broken into. Footballs, helmets, shoulder pads and bags
