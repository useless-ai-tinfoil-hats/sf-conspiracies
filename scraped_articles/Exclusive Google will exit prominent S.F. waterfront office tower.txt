Exclusive: Google will exit prominent S.F. waterfront office tower
-----
A downtown "trophy" office complex with sweeping views of San Francisco Bay is poised to lose a major tenant â€” its second in the span of a year.Tech behemoth Google will be exiting the 300,000-square-foot office that it has occupied at One Market Plaza since 2018, once the company's lease for the space expires next April, a spokesperson for Google confirmed Tuesday. The move follows Visa's exit from the three-building complex, as the company relocated its employees to Mission Rock.
