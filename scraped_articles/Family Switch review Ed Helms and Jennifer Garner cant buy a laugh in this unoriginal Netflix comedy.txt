‘Family Switch’ review: Ed Helms and Jennifer Garner can’t buy a laugh in this unoriginal Netflix comedy
-----
Sometimes the hard part of being a critic is having to say unpleasant things.You probably think that would be the fun part, and occasionally that's true, for example when a movie is not just bad but obnoxious (check out my review of "Black Adam"). But with films like "Family Switch," there's no pleasure in telling the world that it's ghastly and stinks in the nose of civilization. There's no joy in candidly observing that if awfulness were incarnated and saw this movie, it would say,
