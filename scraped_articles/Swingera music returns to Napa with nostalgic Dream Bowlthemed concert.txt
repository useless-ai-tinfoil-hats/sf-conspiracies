Swing-era music returns to Napa with nostalgic Dream Bowl-themed concert
-----
Jazz-pop vocalist Kellie Fuller and pianist Mike Greensill hope to open a portal to the past with their one-night-only Wine Country event, "A Night at the Dream Bowl."Set to take place at JaM Cellars Ballroom in downtown Napa on June 22, the concert will see the veteran performers recreate the music and ambiance of the Bay Area's iconic post-war ballroom Dream Bowl, which once stood just north of Vallejo off Highway 29.
Opened in 1941, the Dream Bowl hosted swing-era luminaries
