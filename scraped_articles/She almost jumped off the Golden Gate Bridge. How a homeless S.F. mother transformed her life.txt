She almost jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. How a homeless S.F. mother transformed her life
-----
Leticia Tate-Azevedo still remembers how desperate and alone she felt as she walked along the Golden Gate Bridge in a beanie and T-shirt at twilight on New Year's Day in 2020.Homeless and addicted to methamphetamine and cocaine, Tate-Azevedo wasn't sure she wanted to live any longer. Scoping out a place to jump, she said she paused and said a prayer: "God, I know what is happening is wrong. I promise if you save my life from this bridge, I will not go back. I will get myself together."
