How a kids playdate in Oakland became a flashpoint for racists
-----
The equity and inclusion committee at Oakland's Chabot Elementary School didn't publish the emails and phone numbers of organizers when advertising its "playdate" for students of color on Aug. 26."Something told me not to do it," said Briana, the co-chair of the committee who is Black, has a child who attends the school and asked that I not use her last name due to safety concerns. "Maybe it was my ancestors talking to me."
Those ancestors must have known racism is still thriving
