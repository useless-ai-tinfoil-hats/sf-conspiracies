49ers' Brock Purdy quiets the critics with bevy of deep balls vs. Seahawks
-----
Brock Purdy further helped his MVP case for the 49ers on Sunday â€“ and added a few deep passes that can push back at some of the criticisms leveled against him, too.Purdy threw for a career-high 368 yards while completing 19-of-27 passes in the 49ers' 28-16 win over the Seahawks, but perhaps most impressive was Purdy's performance on deep balls, completing all six passes that went 16 yards or further beyond the line of scrimmage.
