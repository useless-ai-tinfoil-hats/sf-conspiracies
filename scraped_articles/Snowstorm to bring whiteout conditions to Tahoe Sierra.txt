Snowstorm to bring whiteout conditions to Tahoe, Sierra
-----
A cold winter storm is anticipated to bring widespread mountain snow to the Intermountain West this weekend, and the Sierra Nevada is expected to be in the bull's-eye.Snow will begin over the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon on Friday night, arriving at California's Mount Shasta by daybreak Saturday. Blizzard-like conditions are possible along I-80 by the late morning, continuing into the evening. The Southern Sierra will eventually get hit by the snow in the later afternoon.
