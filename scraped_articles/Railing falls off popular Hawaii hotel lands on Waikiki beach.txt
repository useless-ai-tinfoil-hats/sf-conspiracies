On Jan. 30, around 1 p.m., a railing fell off a hotel balcony on the fifth floor at the Moana Surfrider in Waikiki, Hawaii, nearly missing a passerby before it fell onto the beach."When I went to the bedroom balcony and looked down, I saw where it landed, and I thought 'Thank God' because two feet either way it probably would have killed somebody," a guest told Hawaii News Now.
The railing didn't directly hit anyone, the Honolulu Fire Department told Hawaii News Now, but one person
