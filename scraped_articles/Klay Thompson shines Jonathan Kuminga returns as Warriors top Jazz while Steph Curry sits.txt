-----
The Golden State Warriors rested Stephen Curry on Sunday, knowing they'll need him for their most important games in the NBA play-in tournament. They certainly didn't need him against the Utah Jazz, whom they tore down at Chase Center anyway.The Warriors rolled without their star guard to a 118-110 victory over the Jazz at Chase Center. Klay Thompson scored 25 of his team-high 32 points in the first half, bringing Curry to his feet in celebration with six more 3-pointers.
