Golden Gate Fields-based Lammas put a fitting exclamation point on the track's final stakes race when he won Saturday's Grade 3, $177,700 San Francisco Mile in the second-fastest clocking in the event's 46-year turf course history."I wanted to win so badly for Northern California," said jockey Irving Orozco, who joined with trainer Manny Badilla to collect the richest victory of their careers.
Golden Gate Fields is scheduled to close when the winter-spring season ends June 9,
