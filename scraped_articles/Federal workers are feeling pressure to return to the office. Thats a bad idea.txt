Federal workers are feeling pressure to return to the office. That’s a bad idea
-----
The ongoing effort by employers to get their workers back in the office is also playing out at the federal level. Since President Biden pledged that "the vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person" in his 2022 State of the Union address, there has been pressure for federal employees to come back to the office — from Republicans in Congress to the Democratic mayor of D.C. to the president's own chief of staff.So far, that hasn't really happened. That's a good thing.
