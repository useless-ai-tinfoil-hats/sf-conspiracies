San Jose mayor, up for re-election next year, touts efforts to reduce homelessness, crime
-----
In his first State of the City address, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan made the case Saturday that the city has progressed in reducing homelessness and crime over his first nine months in office.Mahan became mayor in January after serving two years on San Jose's City Council. Because of a ballot measure passed last year to align San Jose's mayoral elections with the presidential election cycle, Mahan will be up for reelection in March 2024. So far, he's the only one campaigning for the job.
