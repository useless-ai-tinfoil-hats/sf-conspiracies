Stanford women's basketball team eyes a big change after being forced to go small
-----
Stanford women's basketball has always had size. The past two seasons especially, the Cardinal's strength came in their post play more than the perimeter, led by All-American Cameron Brink and honorable mention Kiki Iriafen.But now those two are gone, Iriafen transferring to USC and Brink going on to a strong WNBA rookie campaign, and the tallest returner for the Cardinal is 6-foot-3 Brooke Demetre, whose perimeter shooting skill is too valuable to make her a true post.
