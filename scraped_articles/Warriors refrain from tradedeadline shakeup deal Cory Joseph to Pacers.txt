Warriors refrain from trade-deadline shakeup, deal Cory Joseph to Pacers
-----
INDIANAPOLIS â€” The NBA's annual trade deadline, falling at noon PST Thursday, was more Shakespeare than shake-up for the Golden State Warriors:Much ado about nothing. For the most part, anyway.
The Warriors maintained the nucleus of their team but made a minor deal, trading reserve guard Cory Joseph, a top-55 protected pick in the 2025 NBA draft via the Charlotte Hornets and cash to the Indiana Pacers for a second-round pick in the 2024 draft, the team announced Thursday evening.
