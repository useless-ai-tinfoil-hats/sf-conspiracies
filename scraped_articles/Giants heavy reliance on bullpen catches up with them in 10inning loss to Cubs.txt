Giantsâ€™ heavy reliance on bullpen catches up with them in 10-inning loss to Cubs
-----
The recent run of bullpen games caught up to the San Francisco Giants on Thursday when struggling Luke Jackson was one of few relievers available in the 10th inning of a tie game.Jackson left a slider hanging for Ian Happ, who hit it just far enough in center field to bounce off the top of the Oracle Park fence for a game-winning two-run homer in the Giants' 5-3 loss to the Chicago Cubs. The loss prevented the Giants from sweeping the four-game series and ended their win streak at three.
