I visited a San Francisco bar covered in 6 tons of sand
-----
It's a cold Thursday night in November and I'm the only one in Del Mar wearing flip-flops.It's "Beach Party" week at the tropically inspired bar in San Francisco's Marina District, and owner and general manager Michael Wilbert has taken the theme to its literal extreme. On Wednesday, he spread 6 tons of sand across the bar's floor. On Sunday, he will remove 6 tons of sand from the bar's floor.
Off to the side of the space, two beach chairs frame a sandcastle. A few plastic shovels
