Horoscope for Tuesday, 04/09/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): It's hard parting with something that was gifted to you, but return it. A gift isn't a gift if the giver wants it back.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): A superior is being especially demanding. Do your best to accommodate because resistance now will only make matters worse.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): It feels like people are being unfair, but is your defiance justified? Take the out they're giving you before the slippery slope gets slipperier.
CANCER
