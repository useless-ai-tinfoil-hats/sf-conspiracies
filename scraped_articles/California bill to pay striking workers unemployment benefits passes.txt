California bill to pay striking workers unemployment benefits passes
-----
California workers on strike could be paid unemployment benefits under a bill lawmakers sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday.The measure, SB799, would make striking workers eligible for unemployment payments after two weeks on strike.
"For me, it's critical that for the worker and the economy to have security and, to have a seat at the table to be able to advocate for themselves without having the fear of losing their home or not being able to send their kids to school," said Sen.
