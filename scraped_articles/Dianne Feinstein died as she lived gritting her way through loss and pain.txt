Dianne Feinstein died as she lived, gritting her way through loss and pain
-----
Dianne Feinstein died as she so often lived: buffeted by tragedy and sorrow. Her final years were marked by decline, loss and pain. A woman long defined by her control, dignity and grit succumbed to the cruel humiliations of age in the unsparing spotlight of the digital age.In retrospect, most would say it was a mistake for her to run again in 2018 at age 85. Rationally, I'm tempted to agree. Then again, I knew Feinstein, having served as her communications director from 2008 to 2011.
