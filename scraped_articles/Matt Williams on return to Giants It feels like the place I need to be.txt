Matt Williams on return to Giants: ‘It feels like the place I need to be’
-----
Monday marked the 27th anniversary of the San Francisco Giants' trade of third baseman Matt Williams to Cleveland. That deal was not especially popular among Giants fans, though it did bring future National League MVP Jeff Kent in return.Nearly three decades later, Williams is back. He will serve as new manager Bob Melvin's third-base coach next season, as the team announced last week, finally putting Williams in a Giants uniform again.
And, yes, that carries special significance.
