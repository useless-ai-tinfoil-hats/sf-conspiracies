Going into politics was not an option until last year for Manuel Noris-Barrera, 50, an immigrant from Mexico with a crepe shop on San Francisco's Mission Street.The longtime Republican had been so disappointed by former President Donald Trump's 2020 defeat that he re-registered as an independent in 2022, what Noris-Barrera described as "a one-year lapse" in his Grand Old Party membership.
"What is the point of being Republican?" he said. "Nobody wants to support a loser team."
