Beautiful tortillas, smoky beef and powerful salsas: The Bay Areaâ€™s taco queen is back
-----
My favorite taco in the Bay Area is technically free. It isn't even on the menu.Consisting of only beans and a freshly made flour tortilla, it's a botana (snack) that Tacos Mama Cuca owner Maria Marquez often gifts to guests. (You may need to ask for it.) Really, it's an invitation, welcoming you to her slice of Sonora, akin to a mother's apapacho (warm soulful embrace).
The taco's simplicity gives you a chance to appreciate Marquez's masterful tortillas. Each one is a revelation
