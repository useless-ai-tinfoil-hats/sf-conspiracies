Supreme Court justices zeroed in on this legal issue in abortion pill hearing
-----
Anti-abortion doctors challenging the government's approval of the widely used abortion pill mifepristone must show that they will be harmed by its use in order to have legal "standing" to sue. Whether they can do so was questioned at Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing by conservative justices who may cast decisive votes in the case."Under federal law, no doctors can be forced against their conscience to perform or assist in an abortion, correct?" asked Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
