UC Berkeley task force recommends new names for academic, athletic entities to avoid 'confusion'
-----
A century and a half after the founding of UC Berkeley, campus leaders determined that the name of the world-famous university was too confusing because many people, usually athletes and fans, also called it Cal.Simplicity was the goal in repairing the problem.
A 19-member task force was convened and an 18-page document created. Nearly a year later, the veil has lifted and the recommendations revealed: The university should replace its two old names with two new names.
