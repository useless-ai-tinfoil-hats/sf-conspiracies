BART’s new rules affect where you can take your bike
-----
BART will start letting riders take their bicycles on escalators and secure them inside of train cars, rather than holding them the entire time.The new policies come from a rule change BART's board of directors adopted at their Thursday meeting. Riders will also be allowed to take their bikes on any car except the first car or any crowded car — a change inspired by the transit agency's new, shorter trains.
BART's old rules restricted bikes to elevators or stairs and required riders
