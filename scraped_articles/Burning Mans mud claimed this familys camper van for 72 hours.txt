Burning Man's mud claimed this family's camper van for 72 hours
-----
Lori Earl walked alone across the desert outside of Black Rock City, Nevada.In pigtails and a hat bedazzled with rhinestones spelling out "LOVE," the British Columbian mom was headed for her 1985 Dodge Ram camper van, which had been stuck in the desert outside of Burning Man for all of Labor Day weekend. It would be nice if the mud had hardened to the point where she'd be able to drive out, but she wasn't getting her hopes up.
