Why there’s a new fee on wine and liquor in California this year
-----
Starting this month, Californians will pay a little bit more for wine and spirits. The new fee is refundable — but only if they bring their empty bottles to a recycling center, which can be difficult to access.Just like soda bottles and beer cans, wine and liquor containers are now subject to California Refund Value, thanks to a state law that took effect Jan. 1. That means that when you purchase a bottle of wine, you'll pay a deposit on it, which you can recover if you return it empty.
