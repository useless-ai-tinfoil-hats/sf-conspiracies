I made the worst Coachella drive decision possible and paid the price

People will give you a lot of advice when it comes to attending the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Arrive early to discover a new favorite band, wear copious amounts of sunscreen, and please, please double-check that you have your camping pass. But the advice that I most wish I heeded on my first trip to the festival was among the most obvious: With over 125,000 people converging on the festival grounds in Indio every day, you should absolutely figure out the best time to head home.
