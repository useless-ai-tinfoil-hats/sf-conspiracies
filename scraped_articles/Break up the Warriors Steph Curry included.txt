Let's go back to the summer of 2019, a more innocent time in our nation's history. None of us knew what a KN95 mask was. White collar workers actually traveled for business rather than spending all day having to mute a Zoom mic anytime they had to fart. Donald Trump was a gentle, widely beloved president rather than the half-assed orchestrator of a failed revolution. And the Golden State Warriors were still really good.I was in Oakland that June, hanging around the Lake Chalet to profile
