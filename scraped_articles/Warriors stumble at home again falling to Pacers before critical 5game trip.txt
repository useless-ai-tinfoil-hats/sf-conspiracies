Warriors stumble at home again, falling to Pacers before critical 5-game trip
-----
The Golden State Warriors are consistent, all right. Consistently inconsistent in the way they play basketball.With 13 games to play entering Sunday, they've "got to figure out how to play right. We've got to compete. And we've got to win," said point guard Chris Paul. "We're basically fighting for a chance at the playoffs."
Wouldn't have known it Friday night.
The Warriors were outworked by the Indiana Pacers, squandering a 12-point lead at Chase Center en route to a 123-111
