Show & Tell with Tony Bravo: Pliés and pirouettes with S.F. Ballet’s Jasmine Jimison
-----
The December edition of Show & Tell with Tony Bravo spotlights ballet in San Francisco — and its range of interpretations. Tony gets straight to the pointe with his guests: S.F. Ballet soloist Jasmine Jimison, who has danced nearly every principal role from Queen of the Snow to Sugar Plum Fairy in the company's annual "Nutcracker," and the nonbinary-fronted gutter pop band band Pleeay (pronounced plié), whose ballet-dancing front person performs to Boy Jr. meets Mitski and early Björk sounds.
