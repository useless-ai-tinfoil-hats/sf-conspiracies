The darkest corners of Pinnacles, one of California's least-explored national parks
-----
Stepping carefully through Balconies Cave in Pinnacles National Park, I surveyed my dark and mysterious surroundings and tried to keep it together. The damp walls, tight squeezes, creepy echoes and lack of light were all a bit disorienting. But I seemed to be headed in the right direction, and this was a family-friendly cave, I reminded myself. Any 5-year-old could do it!Perhaps that's why it's one of the most popular activities in this small but mighty national park.
