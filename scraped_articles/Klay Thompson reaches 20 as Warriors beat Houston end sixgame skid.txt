Klay Thompson reaches 20 as Warriors beat Houston, end six-game skid
-----
There once was a time, not long ago, when Klay Thompson scoring 20 points in an NBA game did not qualify as news. Ho hum. He's Klay Thompson.But the first month-plus of this season did not unfold the way Thompson or the Golden State Warriors wanted. Thompson struggled, the Warriors struggled and Thompson began Thanksgiving week still searching for his first 20-point performance.
When he finally got it Monday night at Chase Center, scoring exactly 20 in his team's 121-116 victory
