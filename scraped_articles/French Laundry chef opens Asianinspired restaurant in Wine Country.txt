French Laundry chef opens Asian-inspired restaurant in Wine Country
-----
Famed chef Thomas Keller has opened a new Napa Valley restaurant â€” sort of. Last month, the Michelin-lauded chef quietly evolved his swanky caviar destination in Yountville into a fresh restaurant with Asian influences and plenty more caviar.Named RO Restaurant and Lounge, the new spot has taken over the Regiis Ova Caviar & Champagne Lounge at 6480 Washington St. in Yountville, which debuted as a pop-up in 2021 to promote the caviar company Keller founded with expert Shaoching Bishop.
