San Francisco is a ghost town this week
-----
San Francisco's Union Square was pleasantly quiet late Tuesday afternoon.The 83-foot-tall tree twinkled above a plaza that felt vacant at a time when the sun was still shining and the air was balmy. About a dozen people whirled around the ice skating rink, but other than that there was very little movement. The stores and restaurants in the area were open, but most were quiet â€” except the Apple Store on Post Street that still had a big crowd.
