When the Kardashians get stoned, one restaurant draws them in.In "The Kardashians," Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian decided to share a weed gummy during a quick retreat to Palm Springs.
After splitting the gummy, the mother-daughter superstar reality TV duo digressed into a minute-long magnum opus of loosely knotted together recollections and affirmations, ending with Kris declaring, "We should get tacos!"
And get tacos they did.
