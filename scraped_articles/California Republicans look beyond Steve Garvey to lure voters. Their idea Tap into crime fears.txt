California Republicans look beyond Steve Garvey to lure voters. Their idea: Tap into crime fears
-----
Republican Senate candidate Steve Garvey didn't show up this weekend to the biggest Republican gig of the year, the three-day California Republican Party convention in Burlingame that ended Sunday.And the reaction among the 800 top grassroots activists and party leaders: Meh.
They feel they've got better ways to rally Republican voters to the polls than to depend on the former Los Angeles Dodger, who has never run for office before and has run a largely below-the-radar campaign.
