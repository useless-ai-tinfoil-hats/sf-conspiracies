Pumpkin Pet Insurance at a glancePumpkin stands out as a top pet insurance company â€” and a solid option for younger pets, with special wellness plans for puppies and a base plan that includes microchipping coverage. Pumpkin Pet Insurance also covers curable pre-existing conditions after only 180 days. Still, it doesn't offer accident-only policies, and oddly, there's no mobile app for submitting claims.
* Standard waiting period: 14 days for accidents and illnesses.
