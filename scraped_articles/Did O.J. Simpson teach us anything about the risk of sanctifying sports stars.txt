Did O.J. Simpson teach us anything about the risk of sanctifying sports stars?
-----
Nobody fooled us like O.J. Simpson fooled us. All of us.Would-be tacklers? They zigged, but O.J. zagged, and he was gone. We could argue all day where Simpson ranks all-time among running backs, but his combo of power, speed and elegance stands alone.
That generation of flailing, flummoxed defenders wasn't alone. Simpson fooled us all.
The most dominating athlete, the coolest sports celebrity, the handsomest model of American sports and sportsmanship, was something far uglier
