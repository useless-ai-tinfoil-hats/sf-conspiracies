I canâ€™t believe this pizza is gluten-free

Here's assistant food and wine editor Caleb PershanGluten-free pizza is all too often a joyless cousin of cardboard. It can be a starchy disaster; a dense, gummy mess. For those who fear carbs, and also flavor, there's even something called "cauliflower crust." Need I go on?
Fortunately, this pizza is nothing like that. The crust is puffy like a neck pillow, freckled brown by a roaring hot oven. It smells yeasty and malty. It holds up perfectly under pressure, cradling toppings
