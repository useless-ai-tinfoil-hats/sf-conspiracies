Starting next year, you can get cash for alcohol bottles in California
-----
Starting next year, Californians will be able to recycle wine and liquor and large juice bottles for cash.The beverage containers will be included in the California Redemption Value fee, a statewide program implemented after the 1986 Bottle Bill in which consumers pay a fee when purchasing beverages packaged in aluminum, glass, plastic and metal. As with containers already subject to the CRV, the fee will be refundable when the bottles are returned to a recycling center beginning Jan. 1.
