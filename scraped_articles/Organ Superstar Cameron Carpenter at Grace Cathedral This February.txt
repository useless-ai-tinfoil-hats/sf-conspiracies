Organ Superstar Cameron Carpenter at Grace Cathedral This February
-----
The 42-year-old pipe organ virtuoso has taken a sledgehammer to classical music conventions and has become a trailblazing artist with a forward-thinking vision and approach to the art form. He returns to the sacred space at Grace Cathedral and its historic 1934 Æolian-Skinner pipe organ for two nights — the first devoted to the work of J.S. Bach (2/16), and the second providing the musical lifeblood to Fritz Lang's 1927 science fiction landmark 'Metropolis' (2/17).WHEN
