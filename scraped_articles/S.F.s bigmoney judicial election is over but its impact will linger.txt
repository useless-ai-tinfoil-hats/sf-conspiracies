S.F.’s big-money judicial election is over, but its impact will linger
-----
San Francisco is finished with judicial elections for the year. Two incumbent judges were contested in March. The challengers raised over $1.1 million, compared to about $693,000 for the incumbents — astounding sums.In the end, the incumbents prevailed. Even though the election is over, its impact will linger.
As a superior court judge in San Francisco, I've faced and survived my own electoral challenge. What do judges like me think about when our time to be challenged comes due?
