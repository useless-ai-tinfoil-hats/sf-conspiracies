Like Black women, white women can have Kamala Harrisâ€™ back, too
-----
As a white woman, I had to learn how to pronounce her name KA-ma-la. I joined several "Childless Cat Ladies for Harris" Facebook groups even though I'm allergic to cats. I wash dishes listening to Keb' Mo' and Rosanne Cash sing "Put a Woman in Charge."Now that the November election is no longer a La Brea Tar Pits struggle between aging stegosaurs, I have political hope. But when I talked to a Southern California friend whose parents are immigrants from India, she was decidedly cool.
