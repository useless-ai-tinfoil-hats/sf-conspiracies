Review: Promising young singers come together one last time in Merola Grand Finale
-----
As the first big highlight landed midway through the first half of this year's Merola Grand Finale concert, a charge ran through San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House.Soprano Lydia Grindatto, in the title role of Bellini's "Norma," and mezzo-soprano Simona Genga, as the conflicted Adalgisa, set off the spark in a vocally ravishing, emotionally penetrating duet. As the scene's tension built, the young singers' lustrous voices ascended in parallel and transparently converging harmonies.
