'Nightmare': How a major outage at an SF high-rise turned into monthlong saga for residents
-----
When the power first went out at the Paramount, a luxury high-rise in downtown San Francisco, on the morning of Feb. 21, resident Dylan Dawson assumed it would be a temporary blip. The situation ended up spiraling into a monthlong saga.By nightfall, the 43-story building's emergency generator wasn't working, and he and other residents had to evacuate without the use of elevators or emergency lighting, while some older or disabled residents couldn't exit at all, Dawson told SFGATE.
