Giants' Joey Bart, once Buster Posey’s heir apparent, designated for assignment
-----
SAN DIEGO — Joey Bart, once deemed Buster Posey's heir apparent behind the plate for the San Francisco Giants, was designated for assignment Sunday to make room on the 40-man roster for right-hander Daulton Jefferies.Bart made the Opening Day roster as a third catcher behind Patrick Bailey and Tom Murphy, but it was a situation that was not sustainable. Bart will have to clear waivers to remain in the organization, but interest from other teams in the 27-year-old catcher could be high.
