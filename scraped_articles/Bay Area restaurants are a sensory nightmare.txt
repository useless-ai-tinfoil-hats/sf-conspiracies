Bay Area restaurants are a sensory nightmare
-----
When you first step inside, Tosca Cafe is exactly what you'd imagine a historic restaurant in North Beach to look like.As you walk past the murals of Venice, Italy, and couples celebrating anniversaries and birthdays, you're quickly seated in a red booth under the warm glow of a chandelier. While the server pours you another glass of Sangiovese made with grapes harvested from Tuscany, you carefully bite into the richest arancini you've ever had. It all seems overwhelmingly luxurious.
