Judge blocks California district’s rule requiring schools to out transgender students
-----
A judge barred a Southern California school district Thursday from requiring teachers to notify parents when a student identifies as transgender, saying the policy discriminates against youths based on their gender identity.The policy adopted by the Chino Valley Unified School District in July — the first of its kind in the state — "treats otherwise similar students differently based on their sex or gender identity" and therefore violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection
