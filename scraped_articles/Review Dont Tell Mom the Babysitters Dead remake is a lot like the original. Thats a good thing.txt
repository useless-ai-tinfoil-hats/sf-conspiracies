Review: ‘Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead’ remake is a lot like the original. That’s a good thing
-----
It's strange what lasts. When "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead" debuted in 1991, it was just another minor comedy that got mostly bad reviews (though not from me; I liked it). But it has stuck around in a quiet sort of way, possibly because audiences just enjoyed Christina Applegate in the lead role, and now it has been remade.That's the first surprise — that a new "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead" even exists. The second surprise is how similar the new one is to the original.
