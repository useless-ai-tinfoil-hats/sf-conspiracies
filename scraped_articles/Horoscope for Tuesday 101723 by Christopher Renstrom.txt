Horoscope for Tuesday, 10/17/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): If the terms aren't right then don't accept them. Yes, you may have to leave that offer on the table, but it's better than agreeing to something you don't like.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You've been so focused on yourself that you haven't paid attention to developments in your partner's life. These will soon take precedence.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Are you being squeezed out at work? Best defend your turf before somebody horns in on it.
