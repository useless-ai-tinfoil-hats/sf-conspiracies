Why this S.F. cocktail whiz just opened a roadside burger stand in the middle of nowhere
-----
San Francisco cocktail whiz Scott Baird, formerly of Trick Dog and 15 Romolo, opened an old-fashioned roadside burger stand on Sunday in an unexpected location: Anderson Valley wine country.Set in a 120-year-old building on Highway 128 about three hours north of San Francisco, Jumbo's Win-Win (8651 Hwy. 128, Philo) brings nostalgia-inducing burgers, fries and soft serve to the budding wine region, which Baird said is seriously starved for "comfortable, fun and affordable" restaurants.
