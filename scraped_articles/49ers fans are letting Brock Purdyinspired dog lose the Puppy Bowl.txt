49ers fans are letting Brock Purdy-inspired dog lose the Puppy Bowl
-----
While San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy may not win the league's highest individual honor this year, Bark Purdy is another story entirely. A dog with a Brock Purdy-inspired name has made it to the finals of the Puppy Bowl's Most Pupular fan vote contest. But it's going to take a strong effort from 49ers fans to get him to the top of the dog mountain â€” as of 8 a.m. PT on Saturday, the chihuahua mix is losing to a terrier mix named Fred in a tightly contested matchup, 58% to 42%.
