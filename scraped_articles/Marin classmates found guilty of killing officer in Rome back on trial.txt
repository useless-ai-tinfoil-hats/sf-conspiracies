Marin classmates found guilty of killing officer in Rome back on trial
-----
Two Bay Area men who were found guilty of killing a police officer in Rome are back on trial to determine if they knew enough Italian to comprehend the chaotic situation that unfolded in the summer of 2019. Italy's highest Cassation Court ordered a new trial last year, saying it hadn't been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants understood that they were dealing with Italian police officers when they went to meet an alleged drug dealer.Finnegan Lee Elder and Gabriel
