It's a Giants nightmare: Dodgers arrive looking like league-beaters while Ohtani is raking
-----
The second-worst thing that could have happened to San Francisco Giants fans was the dreaded Los Angeles Dodgers signing Shohei Ohtani, and several other stars, last offseason.The first worst thing is happening now. Ohtani and those other new L.A. signees are playing their fannies off. They are earning all that money they are being paid. For the moment, anyway, money can buy happiness.
And here they come. The Dodgers are in town for three games, and it could get ugly.
Never
