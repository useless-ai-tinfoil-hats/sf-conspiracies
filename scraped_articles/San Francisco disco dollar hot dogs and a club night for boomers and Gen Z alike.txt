San Francisco disco, dollar hot dogs, and a club night for boomers and Gen Z alike
-----
Do you ever wake up on a spring morning, catch a rare ray of San Francisco sun on your face and think, "Wow, I'm lucky to live in the San Francisco Bay Area"?We do. In a new column, SFGATE writers break down the best local color from the past week. This installment features a "Goosebumps"-style choose-your-own-adventure drag show, a literal (Italian) sausage fest in North Beach and the cheapest hot dogs in the Bay Area. Plus, disco is alive and well in 2024 at the Knockout.
