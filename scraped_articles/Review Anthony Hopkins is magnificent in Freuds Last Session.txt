Review: Anthony Hopkins is magnificent in ‘Freud’s Last Session’
-----
It's known that Sigmund Freud, living in London at the end of his life, had a meeting with an Oxford don. "Freud's Last Session" imagines that the don was the author C.S. Lewis, and that the two men had a conversation about life, death and whether God exists.Based on a 2009 play by Mark St. Germain, it's the kind of movie you might expect from Peter Morgan ("The Queen," "Frost/Nixon"), except that it lacks Morgan's bizarre gift for extracting drama out of seemingly undramatic situations.
