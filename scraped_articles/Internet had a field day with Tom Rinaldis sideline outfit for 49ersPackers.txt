Internet had a field day with Tom Rinaldi's sideline outfit for 49ers-Packers
-----
NFL sideline reporter Tom Rinaldi did his best Rob Lowe impersonation on Saturday, donning a hilariously meme-able baseball cap to a Packers-49ers playoff game.If you'll recall, Lowe wore a baseball cap with an NFL logo to a 37-20 49ers win over the Packers in the NFC Championship four years ago, which social media had an absolute field day with it, hilariously mocking him for both looking like a narc and being just a huge fan of the concept of the National Football League in general.
