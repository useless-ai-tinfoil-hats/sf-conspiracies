49ers bring back punt returner Trent Turner in wake of Ray-Ray McCloud's departure
-----
The San Francisco 49ers may not have found their punt returner. But they at least added a legitimate candidate for the job on Tuesday.The 49ers signed a familiar face, wide receiver Trent Taylor, who spent his first four seasons in Santa Clara after he was a fifth-round pick in 2017. Taylor, 29, has since made stops with the Bengals (2021-2022) and Bears (2023) and become best known for his punt-returning skills: Taylor has eight catches while returning 63 punts the past three seasons.
