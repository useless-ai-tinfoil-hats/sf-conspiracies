Michael Peters was still on the field well after practice Thursday night, answering questions about his pending retirement as McClymonds football coach.An assistant coach asked him about dinner. It was after 8 p.m.
"That's sorta what I mean," Peters said. "I won't get to dinner until at least 9 or maybe later. That's just the nature of the beast."
