Old-school Bay Area deli Morucciâ€™s is off the beaten path. It still gets lines out the door.
-----
Tucked away from Walnut Creek's bustling downtown food scene, an unassuming little deli just off the highway in the Saranap neighborhood regularly draws lunchtime lines out the door. Called Morucci's Si Mangia Bene, it's the most popular spot in the area for classic deli sandwiches."When I bought this, I'm going, wow, OK, this is pretty wild. I mean, who's going to ever know that we're out here?" said Morucci's owner Robert Fambrini, who took over Morucci's in the mid-1990s.
