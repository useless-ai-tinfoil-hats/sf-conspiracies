Scam targeting SF Bay Area drivers resurfaces yet again
-----
FasTrak is sounding the alarm bells yet again about a scam targeting Bay Area drivers.FasTrak, which collects tolls for all Bay Area toll bridges and express lanes, said in an email to customers last week that some people are receiving text messages notifying them of fees with a link that leads to a fraudulent website.
"If you receive such a text, please do not click on the link," the agency said in the email. "FasTrak does not request payment by text with a link to a website."
