Imane Khelif wins Olympic boxing gold, rises above attacks: ‘She’s a heroine’
-----
PARIS — The cacophony of sound poured down from the rafters over Imane Khelif. It rose up from the grandstands and swirled around her, creating a cocoon of protection and pride.From the moment Khelif entered the ring on center court at Roland Garros Stadium until long after she had won a gold medal, in a unanimous decision over China's Yang Liu, the deafening blanket of support covered her.
"That support gave me strength," Khelif said late in the night. "It made me persevere."
