-----
Elon Musk dropped his breach of contract lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman Tuesday, three months after he took the company to court demanding it hand over its source code and accusing it of illegally straying from its founding principles to develop artificial intelligence safely.Musk's attorneys asked to withdraw the complaint entirely without prejudice in a brief filing in San Francisco Superior Court a day before OpenAI was set to ask a judge to dismiss the case.
