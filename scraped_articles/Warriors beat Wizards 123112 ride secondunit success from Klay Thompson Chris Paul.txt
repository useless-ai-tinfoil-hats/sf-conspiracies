Warriors beat Wizards 123-112, ride second-unit success from Klay Thompson, Chris Paul
-----
WASHINGTON — Klay Thompson was already easing into his role as a reserve for the Golden State Warriors.But his easing got easier Tuesday with Chris Paul's return to the rotation.
"You've got two Hall of Famers in the backcourt coming off the bench," Thompson said after scoring 25 points. "We take pride in that and I think it makes our team more dangerous. It's something to build off. … And we've still got another level to get to."
