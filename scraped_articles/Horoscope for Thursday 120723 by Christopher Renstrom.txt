Horoscope for Thursday, 12/07/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): Belief is about accepting something as true. Faith shows a willingness to make it come true. You need to take that leap today.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Prick up your ears because a casual comment holds the key to your troubles. That said you need to think associatively; not logically.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): If it looks like the short end of the stick and feels like the short end of the stick then guess what? Nevertheless this is still better
