Electric scooter and Season of Sharing let Santa Clara woman and her dog regain independence
-----
Doris Dennis stood in front of her stove frying homemade taquitos. After only a few minutes, she wiped the sweat from her forehead and collapsed onto a chair, out of breath.Dennis, 62, suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and osteoarthritis, and has trouble walking. On most days, she's confined to her studio apartment in Santa Clara with her Chihuahua rescue named Precious, watching scary movies and putting together 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles.
