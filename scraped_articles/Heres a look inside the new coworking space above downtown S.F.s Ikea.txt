Here’s a look inside the new coworking space above downtown S.F.’s Ikea
-----
Hej!Workshop, the coworking space that crowns San Francisco's only Ikea store in Mid-Market, launched last week, and now the Chronicle has taken a look inside.A separate doorway adjacent to Ikea's entrance at 945 Market St. leads to a ground-floor lobby that was still under construction as of Tuesday — it provides escalator and elevator access to the fifth floor. That's where Hej! Workshop, the coworking concept by Ikea sister company Ingka Centres, just opened shop.
