Giants out on Yoshinobu Yamamoto, have new competition for Blake Snell
-----
While the San Francisco Giants were focused on free-agent pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, another team has sneaked in to target the other top available starter, Blake Snell.According to one industry source, the Angels have made Snell, the reigning NL Cy Young winner, their priority after losing AL MVP Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers in free agency.
San Francisco also missed signing Ohtani, and the Dodgers reportedly have agreed to terms with Yamamoto on a 12-year, $325 million deal.
