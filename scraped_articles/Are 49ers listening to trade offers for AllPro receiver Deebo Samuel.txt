Are 49ers listening to trade offers for All-Pro receiver Deebo Samuel?
-----
The San Francisco 49ers' other All-Pro wide receiver, Deebo Samuel, is also generating trade interest.The 49ers' offseason has been dominated by speculation that they could deal wideout Brandon Aiyuk due to a contract impasse, but teams were also inquiring about Samuel in the hours before the start of the first round of the NFL draft Thursday night, the Chronicle's Mike Silver reported. The 49ers are listening, but they would have to be overwhelmed by a trade offer to part with Samuel.
