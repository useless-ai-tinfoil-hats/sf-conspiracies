Review: If you’re already wasting your time, you might enjoy ‘American Dreamer’
-----
"American Dreamer" isn't especially entertaining or well-plotted. It's not important, and it doesn't live up to its lofty title. The best that can be said for it — a small but good thing — is that it's an easy movie to hang out with.You can put it on, and live with it for a while, and maybe you'll like the world of it and be pleased and keep watching. And when it's over, you might think, "Well, that was OK," or "That wasn't so good," but you won't mind. "American Dreamer" is not a waste
