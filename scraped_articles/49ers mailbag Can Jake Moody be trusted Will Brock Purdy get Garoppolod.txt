49ers mailbag: Can Jake Moody be trusted? Will Brock Purdy get Garoppoloâ€™d?
-----
The San Francisco 49ers appear primed for a Super Bowl run, but that doesn't mean there aren't concerns as they wait for their first playoff opponent.However, some concerns raised in the latest 49ers' mailbag are more legitimate than others. Their 24-year-old quarterback turning into a postseason handoff machine? Unlikely. Their 24-year-old kicker inspiring elevated-blood-pressure angst? Not hard to imagine.
