San Francisco could be recovering hundreds of stolen cars. Instead, itâ€™s ticketing them
-----
UPDATE: S.F. mayor orders city to stop ticketing stolen vehicles after Chronicle storySusan Ashton is fighting the ticket she got last month on San Francisco's Park Street for blocking a driveway. Same goes for Christy Gagan, who was written up a month before that on Turk Street for getting in the way of street sweeping. Neither woman can match Zoila Toruno, who is pushing back on each of the eight tickets she received in May on Stillman Street.
Why are they fighting the citations?
