Green Day frontman cheekily leaves Bay Area graffiti at Toronto venue
-----
In true punk form, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong left a semi-permanent souvenir behind after the band's Thursday performance in Toronto.In a video posted to his Instagram, Armstrong, armed with a can of spray paint, made his way to an interior hallway of the Rogers Centre, the home of the Toronto Blue Jays. The hallway, lined with the logos of all Major League Baseball teams, then got a semi-permanent alteration: Armstrong spray-painted over the Oakland A's logo.
