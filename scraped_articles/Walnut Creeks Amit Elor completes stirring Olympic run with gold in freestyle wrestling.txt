-----
PARIS — One night earlier, Walnut Creek's Amit Elor reacted with genuine, innocent surprise when she advanced to the gold-medal match in women's freestyle wrestling. "I can't believe this is real," Elor said then.It became even more real Tuesday.
Elor, a 20-year-old who started wrestling at age 4, earned an Olympic gold medal at Champ-de-Mars Arena. She defeated Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan to take the title in the 68-kilogram (150-pound) division and become the youngest U.S.
