Letters: Newsom’s gun control amendment may not work but at least he’s trying to do something

Regarding "Newsom's plan for a constitutional convention is a recipe for a constitutional crisis" (Open Forum, SFChronicle.com, Aug. 25): While I agree with the writer's assessment, I applaud the governor for at least starting a conversation regarding reducing gun violence.Most Americans agree that the rate of deaths due to gun violence is unacceptable. Unfortunately, too many of our elected leaders are unwilling to propose meaningful gun legislation for fear of losing financial support
