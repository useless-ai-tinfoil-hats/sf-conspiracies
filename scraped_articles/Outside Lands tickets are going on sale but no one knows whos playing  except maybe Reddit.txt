Outside Lands tickets are going on sale, but no one knows who's playing â€” except maybe Reddit
-----
San Francisco's premier music festival, Outside Lands, which takes place the second weekend of August, just announced its annual Eager Beaver ticket sale, where fans can score deep discounts on passes beginning April 3 at 10 a.m. This year, Eager Beaver 3-day passes cost $425 for general admission, $665 for GA+, $965 for VIP and $4,895 for the ultra-luxe Golden Gate Club (plus fees, of course). Last year's Eager Beaver GA tickets were $409, so a small price hike, but nothing to complain about.
