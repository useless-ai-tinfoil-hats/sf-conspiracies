UPDATED FORECAST: Major winter storm to bring up to 10 feet of snow in Sierra Nevada this weekAn expanding high-pressure system over the West Coast will keep California warm and dry this weekend, with some Bay Area cities approaching 70 degrees.
Highs will climb to the mid-60s Friday, but warming will be limited by widespread cloud cover. Blue skies Saturday will allow temperatures to jump to the upper 60s to lower 70s, the warmest day so far this February for many Bay Area cities.
