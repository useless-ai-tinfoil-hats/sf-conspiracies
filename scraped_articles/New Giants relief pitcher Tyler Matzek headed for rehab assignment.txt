New Giants relief pitcher Tyler Matzek headed for rehab assignment
-----
Tyler Matzek arrived at Oracle Park on Wednesday after being acquired by the San Francisco Giants from the Braves on Monday and found himself in his friend Luke Jackson's old locker in the reliever corner of the clubhouse.Jackson's locker was free because he went to Atlanta along with Jorge Soler the day before the trade deadline, and there was a major difference with Matzek taking over: Not every surface was packed with stuff.
"So they said I hope I can keep it cleaner than him,"
