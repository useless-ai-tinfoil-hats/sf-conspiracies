What the Sunset Night Market just taught us about revitalizing S.F.
-----
As my wife and I walked past 25th Avenue on Friday night, I noticed people following us. I looked across Irving Street and saw more groups of people walking in the same direction. I've lived in the Sunset since 2004 and there are usually not this many people walking in this area.Could we all possibly be going to the same place?
When we got to 23rd Avenue, the answer was apparent. Irving Street was packed like a pre-pandemic, rush-hour Muni train for the Sunset Night Market.
