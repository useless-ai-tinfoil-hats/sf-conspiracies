Cal Shakes extends deadline for emergency fundraiser
-----
California Shakespeare Theater has extended the deadline for its emergency fundraiser.The East Bay Theater, where actress Zendaya got her start, initially tried to raise $350,000 in a single week for "As You Like It," its first self-produced show in two years scheduled for Sept. 12-29 at the Bruns Amphitheater in Orinda. But since the company's GoFundMe campaign didn't reach that goal by its deadline of Thursday, Aug. 1, the company announced an extension through Monday, Aug. 5.
