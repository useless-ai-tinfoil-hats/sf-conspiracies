-----
Regarding "How S.F.'s big-money moderate groups are trying to influence the next election" (San Francisco, SFChronicle.com, April 29): Mayor London Breed correctly supported Jay Cheng and Neighbors for a Better San Francisco's tough-on-crime stances in recent elections.Breed supported Suzy Loftus for district attorney in 2019, not Chesa Boudin, who was elected. Breed then endorsed the recall of Boudin.
Breed appointed moderate Matt Dorsey as supervisor and supported his reelection.
