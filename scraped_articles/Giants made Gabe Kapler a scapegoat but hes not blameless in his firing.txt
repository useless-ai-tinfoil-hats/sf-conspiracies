Giants made Gabe Kapler a scapegoat, but he’s not blameless in his firing
-----
Logan Webb said the San Francisco Giants needed to make big changes.Friday, the Giants did just that.
After crashing out of the playoff picture in recent weeks, the Giants fired manager Gabe Kapler. In his four seasons at the helm, Kapler oversaw one extraordinary — and aberrational — 107-win season and three postseason misses. Aside from that 2021 season, the Giants have been the picture of mediocrity, a .500 team.
  Who will be Giants' next manager? Bob Melvin, Buster Posey
