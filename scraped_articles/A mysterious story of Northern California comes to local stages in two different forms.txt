A mysterious story of Northern California comes to local stages in two different forms
-----
The first thing the audience hears at the beginning of Eisa Davis' play "Bulrusher" is the title character, a mixed-race teenage girl in Northern California in 1955, declaiming a poem about her own beginnings."I float in a basket toward the Pacific, hands blue as huckleberries," she intones. A few lines later, she explains. "The woman who bore me wrapped me, gave me to the green of the Navarro, named me silence."
It's a distinctive opening, aptly steeped in the evocative mysteries
