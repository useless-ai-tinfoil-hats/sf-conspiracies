Pioneering Oakland restaurant closes after 14 years
-----
One of the Bay Area's first vegan soul food restaurants is now closed.Souley Vegan quietly announced the closing of its original Oakland location with a brief message on its website. "We thank you for your love and support over the years," the message partially reads.
Chef-owner Tamearra Dyson said the very low foot traffic and business activity in the Jack London Square area aren't enough to sustain the business anymore.
"The effort is not worth the trouble," she said.
