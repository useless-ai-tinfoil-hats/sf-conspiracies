-----
After a mass shooter in Half Moon Bay killed seven farmworkers, the Chinese and Latino farmworker communities in the city were united by a shared sense of loss and pain. On the one year anniversary of the shooting, community members came together again, but with hope and art.At a memorial held Tuesday night, members of both communities spoke about the impact of the shooting, and remembered the people lost in an attack police and prosecutors say was carried out by another farmworker.
