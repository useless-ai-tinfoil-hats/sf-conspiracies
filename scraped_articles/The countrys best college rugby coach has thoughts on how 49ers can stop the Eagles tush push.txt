The country's best college rugby coach has thoughts on how 49ers can stop the Eagles' 'tush push'
-----
The 49ers are tasked with the hardest rotating job in the NFL this Sunday with their upcoming matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles and their famed — infamous to some — "tush push." Head coach Kyle Shanahan knows it, star edge rusher Nick Bosa knows it, and Cal's 29-time national champion rugby coach Jack Clark knows it."I don't know that there is a reliable answer to stopping this tactic if they only need a yard or two," Clark told SFGATE over the phone Thursday.
