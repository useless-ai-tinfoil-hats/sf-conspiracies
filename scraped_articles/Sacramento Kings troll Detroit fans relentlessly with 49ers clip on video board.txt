Sacramento Kings troll Detroit fans relentlessly with 49ers clip on video board
-----
The Sacramento Kings' video board guy executed what can only be described as an absolutely vicious troll on Wednesday, replaying footage of 49ers wideout Brandon Aiyuk's wild off-helmet catch in the NFC championship on loop during the visiting Detroit Pistons' entire lineup introduction.In case you live under a rock: The 49ers defeated the Lions (also from Detroit) in heart-breaking fashion in the NFC championship two weekends ago, overcoming a 17-point deficit en route to a 34-31 win
