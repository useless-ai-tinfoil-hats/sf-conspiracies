-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): You have more people in your corner than you think. But you have to trade in the "me against the world" outlook for the "we're all in it together" one.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): It's amazing how an obstacle forced you to explore a different approach. There is a plus side to things not coming easily.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Today the left and right hemispheres of your brain will align. You'll get twice the mental work done for half the effort.
