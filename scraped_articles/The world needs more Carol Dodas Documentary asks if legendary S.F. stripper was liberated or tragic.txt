He knew who the potential renter was: Carol Doda, America's first-ever topless dancer, whose image — and nipples — graced the Condor Club sign at the corner of Columbus Avenue and Broadway in North Beach through the 1960s and '70s.By then she was nearly 60, but alluring as ever with her combination of sexiness and goofball wit.
