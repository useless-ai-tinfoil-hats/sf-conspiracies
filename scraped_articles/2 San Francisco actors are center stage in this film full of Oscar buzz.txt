2 San Francisco actors are center stage in this film full of Oscar buzz
-----
When Clarence "Divine Eye" Maclin first performed the original play "Breakin' the Mummy's Code," it was 2005 and he was an inmate in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New York. When Maclin and the other Rehabilitation Through the Arts members next performed the play, it was 2022, and they were actors in "Sing Sing" â€” not the prison, but A24's new movie based on an article about the original production of the play, alongside Oscar nominee and former San Francisco resident Colman Domingo.
