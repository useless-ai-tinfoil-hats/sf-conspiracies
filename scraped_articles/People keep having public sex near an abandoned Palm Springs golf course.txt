People keep having public sex near an abandoned Palm Springs golf course
-----
A trail near a shuttered Palm Springs golf course has become a popular hookup destination, and local police said they are scratching their heads to figure out why.On the day before Valentine's Day, Palm Springs Police Department announced in a news release that officers were investigating a series of complaints of "lewd conduct" on the Bud Fuhrer Equestrian Trail, near the abandoned Bel Air Greens golf course. In this case, "lewd conduct" appears to be police jargon for public sex.
