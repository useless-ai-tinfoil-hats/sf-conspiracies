Calif. tech investor's wedding trashed base of world-renowned landmark
-----
Castleton Tower is a prominent natural landmark in Utah, near the tiny town of Castle Valley but otherwise ringed by miles of beautiful, rocky scenery.That didn't stop Andrew Chen, a prominent Silicon Valley tech investor, and Emma Waldron, a startup founder and former Miss Ireland, from picking the base of the rock formation for their wedding party site â€” and then, reportedly, trashing it. Now, the couple appears to be trying to wipe some records of the event from the internet.
