Bruce Springsteen rocks San Francisco set after suffering 'motherf—ker of a belly ache'
-----
Bruce Springsteen's return to San Francisco was worth the wait.The Boss' Chase Center show on Thursday night was his first in the city since 2003, a wait made even more agonizing after Springsteen had to postpone the date from late 2023 due to peptic ulcer disease. Or, as Springsteen called it during his set, "a motherf—ker of a belly ache."
Thankfully, fans will barely have to wait for his next San Francisco show: Springsteen is performing at the Chase Center again on Sunday
