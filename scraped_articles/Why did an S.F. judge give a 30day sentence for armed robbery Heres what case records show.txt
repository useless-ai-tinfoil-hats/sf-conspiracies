Why did an S.F. judge give a 30-day sentence for armed robbery? Hereâ€™s what case records show
-----
After a federal judge sentenced a San Francisco man to 30 days in jail for holding a gun to a postal worker's head and stealing his mail, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy called the sentence "unacceptable" and a threat to other postal carriers. A union leader said the judge's decision was "absurd."The sentence generated outrage, and was held up by DeJoy and others as a prime example of the need for more severe punishment for crimes against mail carriers.
