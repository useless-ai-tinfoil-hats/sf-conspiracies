Giants’ David Villar, last year’s forgotten man, no longer in 'a dark place’
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — David Villar's smile is back, and he's looking forward to "a fresh start" this spring with the San Francisco Giants.Villar, 27, is something of the forgotten man in spring camp, but at this point last year, he was tabbed to be the team's every day third baseman. He never got on track, he spiraled in the wrong direction and he appeared so dejected while in a 3-for-40 funk that coaches spoke to him about his body language. He told the Chronicle he was in "a dark place."
