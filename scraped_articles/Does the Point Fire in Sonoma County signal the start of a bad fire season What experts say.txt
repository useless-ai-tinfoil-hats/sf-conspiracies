Does the Point Fire in Sonoma County signal the start of a bad fire season? What experts say
-----
When a wildfire touched off near Healdsburg on Sunday, quickly advancing across more than 1,000 acres, it wasn't just grass that was burning. It was oaks and pines.The Point Fire, next to Lake Sonoma, stands as an outlier among the raft of early season grass fires that have exploded in recent weeks as temperatures in California have shot upward. Usually trees start burning later in the year because they take longer to dry out after winter and spring storms.
