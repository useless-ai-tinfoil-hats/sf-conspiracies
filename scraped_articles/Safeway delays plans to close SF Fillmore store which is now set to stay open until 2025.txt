Safeway delays plans to close SF Fillmore store, which is now set to stay open until 2025
-----
In early January, Safeway announced that it planned to close its Webster Street store in San Francisco's Fillmore District in March after 40 years. Now, Safeway has reversed course, at least temporarily: The store will remain open through early 2025, according to a press release from SF Mayor London Breed's office on Monday."We have decided to extend the closing date to January 2025 to give the community and the City more time to establish a transition plan," Safeway said in a statement.
