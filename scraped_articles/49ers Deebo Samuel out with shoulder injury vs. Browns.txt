-----
It's already been an eventful 49ers game in Cleveland, with a pregame scuffle, multiple missed field goals and penalties galore. But perhaps the biggest headline so far: Niners star wideout Deebo Samuel is out for the game with a shoulder injury, according to Fox's Erin Andrews.Samuel appeared to pick up the injury on the second drive of the first quarter. He initially went into the blue medical tent on the field before walking back to the locker room just before the end of the first.
