-----
In 2022, Google opened a new office called Bay View â€” it's sleek, futuristic and environmentally friendly. You'll just need to bring your own Wi-Fi hot spot.Employees in Mountain View at the first major office campus designed by Google itself might have expected ultrafast internet connections. But Reuters, citing six people familiar with the matter, reported Thursday that the campus "has been plagued for months by inoperable or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi." (Yes, months.)
