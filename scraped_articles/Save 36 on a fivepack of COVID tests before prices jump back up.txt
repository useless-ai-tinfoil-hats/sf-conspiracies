Save 36% on a five-pack of COVID tests before prices jump back up

With COVID-19 still going around and new variants — like the current FLiRT variants — popping up regularly, having a stash of tests at home is still worthwhile. That way, when and if you do get sick, you can test right away, without waiting for a delivery or asking a friend or family member to run to the store for you. Now's a great time to stock up or replenish any tests you've taken recently. A five pack of the iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Tests is just $29 at Amazon for a limited time.
