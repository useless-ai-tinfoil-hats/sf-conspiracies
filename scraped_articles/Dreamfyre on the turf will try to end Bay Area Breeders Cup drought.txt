Dreamfyre, on the turf, will try to end Bay Area Breedersâ€™ Cup drought
-----
When Golden Gate Fields trainer O.J. Jauregui made his annual visit to the Ocala (Fla.) Breeders' Sale in late April, he brought longtime client Danny Eplin with him."In California, you've got to claim horses to have a business, but I told Danny let's step it up a little bit," Jauregui said.
So Eplin bought 2-year-old filly Dreamfyre for $140,000, and she has won all three of her starts to earn a step up all the way to the Breeders' Cup, where she runs in the $1 million Juvenile
