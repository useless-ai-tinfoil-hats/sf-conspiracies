49ers' Kyle Shanahan breaks another trope in comeback win against Lions
-----
For as much success as the 49ers have experienced in the Kyle Shanahan era, the biggest criticism against the head coach was his inability to overcome deficits in big games. Through two games this postseason, he's done some serious damage to those tropes.Against Green Bay last weekend, he snapped a 30-game losing streak when the Niners were trailing by seven points or more. The 49ers entered the fourth quarter down 21-14 to the Packers, but would score the final 10 points to win, 24-21.
