SF hotel known as 'quietest in the country' lands on best-of list
-----
It isn't hard to sell someone on a California hotel when they have the ocean, palm trees or expansive views of the San Francisco Bay from room windows in their marketing materials.Priceless assets like these helped place three California hotels (including two in San Francisco) on an annual list of the 25 "Best of the Best" hotels nationwide, according to travelers who use Tripadvisor.
The Shore Hotel near the beach in Santa Monica was ranked the top hotel in the country.
