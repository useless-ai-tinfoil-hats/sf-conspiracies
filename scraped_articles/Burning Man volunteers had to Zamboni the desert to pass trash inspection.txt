Burning Man volunteers had to 'Zamboni' the desert to pass trash inspection
-----
Volunteers have confirmed what onlookers have guessed: 2023 was an especially challenging year for Burning Man cleanup. The aftermath of the flooded event was so challenging, in fact, that the cleanup team was forced to use construction equipment to steamroll the desert landscape.In November, Burning Man narrowly passed a Bureau of Land Management inspection. Of the 120 points on the playa the BLM inspected, 11 were found to exceed the agency's limit of 1 square foot of debris per acre.
