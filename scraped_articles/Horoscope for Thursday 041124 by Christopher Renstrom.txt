It's an excellent time for pitches, negotiations and off the truck sales.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): This is the time to roll with things as they come. There are a lot of game-changing developments between now and month's end so think fast!
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): A hope is dashed at the same time that a wish is fulfilled. It's enough to make your head spin so find something to hold on
