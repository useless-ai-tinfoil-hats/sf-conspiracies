Equipment issues caused significant morning travel issues for East Bay BART riders Friday morning, as the transit agency reported that there was no Red or Orange line services between its Richmond and MacArthur stations."Crews are on scene and are troubling shooting the problem," BART officials said in a statement. "We hope to have this resolved shortly but expect this service disruption to last through the morning commute."
Richmond riders were advised to seek alternative routes
