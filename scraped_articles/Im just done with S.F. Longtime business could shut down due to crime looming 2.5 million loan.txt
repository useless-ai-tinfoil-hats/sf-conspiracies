‘I’m just done with S.F.’: Longtime business could shut down due to crime, looming $2.5 million loan
-----
Mark Sackett has owned a South of Market building with a printmaker, antiques shop and events venue called the Box SF for almost two decades.But he's facing financial ruin because he's been unable to refinance a $2.5 million mortgage due in February. His building at 1069 Howard St. is scheduled to be auctioned on Jan. 24 "at a massive loss," and he expects all his businesses will be forced to close. Antiques dating back to the 1800s, such as books and engraving plates, could be sold off
