28-year-old SF business Scarlet Sage looks to sell to new owners
-----
The Scarlet Sage, an herbal apothecary that's been operating for 28 years in San Francisco, plans to sell to a new owner in 2024.Owner Laura Ash announced last week via the store's newsletter that she's looking for someone to take over the business. It was a hard decision, Ash told SFGATE, but she wants to focus full-time on the herbal medicine school she started out of the Scarlet Sage in 2018 and spend more time with her family.
It's also been the toughest year she's ever had at
