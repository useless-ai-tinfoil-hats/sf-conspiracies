Hawaii has an illegal fireworks problem unlike any other state
-----
Leading up to Jan. 1, 2024, it's likely that Hawaii residents will light up the night sky over the island of Oahu with thousands of illegal fireworks to celebrate the coming of the New Year, as they've done in years before.The entire island will erupt with the sound of firecrackers and sight of illegal aerials shooting into the air in a series of blasts, 360 degrees around, while clouds of black smoke and the smell of sulfur hover over towns and billow in and out of houses.
