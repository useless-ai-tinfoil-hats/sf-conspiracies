-----
CVS plans to close another location in San Francisco early next year.The health chain will shutter its Lower Haight store at 499 Haight Street on Jan. 11, the company confirmed to SFGATE.
It was a "difficult decision," according to spokesperson Amy Thibault, and factors like "local market dynamics" and "population shifts" weighed in, as did store density.
All prescriptions at the Haight Street location will be transferred to the CVS Pharmacy at 701 Van Ness Ave., she added.
