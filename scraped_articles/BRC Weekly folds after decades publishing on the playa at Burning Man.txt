BRC Weekly folds after decades publishing on the playa at Burning Man
-----
Adriana Roberts hasn't spent a Labor Day weekend in San Francisco for 30 years, but now that she's published the final issue of the newspaper she printed exclusively for Burning Man, she's ready to see for herself just how mellow the city becomes during the event."Everybody always talks about it, and I want to see if all the rumors are true," Roberts told SFGATE by phone. "I don't own a car, but I will borrow one just to see how easy it is to find street parking during Burning Man."
