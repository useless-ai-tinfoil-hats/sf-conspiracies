Horoscope for Friday, 03/08/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Don't say the first thing that comes to mind. Mercury is conjunct Neptune today and that innocent Freudian slip could send you running for cover.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Two courses of action aren't as contradictory as you think. Take a step back and you'll soon see how one complements the other.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Mercury under the influence of Neptune is like its own altered state. Avoid alcohol or operating heavy machinery today.
