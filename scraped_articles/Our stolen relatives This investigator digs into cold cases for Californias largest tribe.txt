‘Our stolen relatives’: This investigator digs into cold cases for California’s largest tribe
-----
Julia Oliveira has one of the most sprawling territories of any law enforcement officer in California. An Indigenous person originally from Oklahoma, she investigates cold cases — unsolved killings and disappearances — for the Yurok Tribe of Northern California, whose reservation stretches through the soaring sequoias of rural Humboldt and Del Norte counties.It's a 2½-hour journey to drive across the tribe's land; there's only cellphone service for 10 to 20 minutes of that trip.
