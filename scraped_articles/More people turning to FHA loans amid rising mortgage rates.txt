More people turning to FHA loans amid rising mortgage rates
-----
Mortgage rates have been on the upswing for nearly two years now, and as of last week, they were at their highest point in almost 23 years.Borrowers are dealing with those rates in a multitude of ways. Many are trying buydowns (paying an upfront fee for a lower interest rate) while others are choosing lower-cost homes, hoping to offset the higher interest costs and balance out their monthly payments.
Some are pivoting toward more affordable loan programs, too â€” namely, FHA loans.
