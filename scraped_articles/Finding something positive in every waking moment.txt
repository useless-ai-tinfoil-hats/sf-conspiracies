Finding something positive in every waking moment
-----
Why does a person get up in the morning? Some days it's a way to escape dreams. For the past year, I've had this recurring nightmare that I was running late for my job at Gimbel's, or at the jail, and the subway stopped. And I had to run, only my feet didn't move. When I woke up, it was a relief.But most days most people aren't waking up from something. Most people are waking up toward something.
Why does a person get up in the morning? To watch the twilight turn golden on Glen
