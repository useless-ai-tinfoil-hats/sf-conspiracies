Is this the best Deebo Samuel weâ€™ve ever seen? 49ers' WR scorches Seahawks again
-----
Deebo Samuel started this year by describing his 2022 season as "awful" in "every aspect."The San Francisco 49ers' receiver minces no words, whether it's calling an opponent "trash" or ripping himself for looking "sluggish" and "bad on tape." After last season, Samuel vowed to never again put below-par footage of himself out there for his opponents to scout.
Thirteen games into the season, Samuel is instead putting a highlight reel together. One of greatness, in every aspect.
