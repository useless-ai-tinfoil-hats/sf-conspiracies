Giants’ rookie Kyle Harrison brings to mind visions of Madison Bumgarner
-----
CHICAGO — Comparisons have been drawn between San Francisco Giants rookie left-hander Kyle Harrison and franchise World Series legend Madison Bumgarner since Harrison's last start in San Diego.The way Harrison stared down Juan Soto while refusing to get intimidated was Bumgarner-esque. Not to mention the way he has gone after hitters.
As it turns out, while growing up in the East Bay, Harrison saw a lot of Bumgarner. The De La Salle-Concord alum was 13 when Bumgarner was named MVP
