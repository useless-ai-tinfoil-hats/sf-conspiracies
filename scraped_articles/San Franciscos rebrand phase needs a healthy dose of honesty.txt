San Franciscoâ€™s rebrand phase needs a healthy dose of honesty
-----
In New York's Times Square sits a billboard for San Francisco's $6 million Always San Francisco advertising campaign to drum up tourism.The billboard shows a link to the official San Francisco tourism website, where there's a charming video seemingly pulled out of a fairy tale. The video shows people dancing in front of the Ferry Building and joyfully riding a streetcar. The camera pans across San Francisco's majestic Golden Gate Bridge and vibrant Chinatown and Castro neighborhoods.
