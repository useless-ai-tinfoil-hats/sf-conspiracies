A narrow road, two horses and a panic attack: One womanâ€™s escape from a California inferno
-----
Lori Osbon had been inching her Chevy Tahoe down a dark, dusty logging road for hours, pulling a heavy trailer containing her two beloved horses. Then the caravan of vehicles she had joined stopped. Osbon heard a woman yell that they still had 8 miles to go."I went into a full blown panic attack," Osbon recalled. She was crying, her hands shaking and feet numb. "I was too frightened. I was picturing myself falling off the cliff, and the horses with broken legs."
