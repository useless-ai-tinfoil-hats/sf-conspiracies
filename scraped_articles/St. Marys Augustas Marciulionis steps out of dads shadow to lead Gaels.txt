St. Mary's Augustas Marciulionis steps out of dad's shadow to lead Gaels
-----
At the start of his team's retreat last month in Lake Tahoe, St. Mary's men's basketball coach Randy Bennett played a documentary for his players called "The Other Dream Team."It details how the Lithuanian national basketball team, led by then-Golden State Warriors guard Sarunas Marciulionis, shocked the world by winning bronze at the 1992 Summer Olympics. As Sarunas' son, St. Mary's junior guard Augustas Marciulionis, watched with his teammates, Bennett noticed Augustas' eyes widen.
