'Like a Porta Potty': Bay Area residents line up for 'exceptional' Golden Gate Park event
-----
A rare Indonesian plant called a corpse flower began to bloom Tuesday afternoon at San Francisco's Academy of Sciences, and by Wednesday morning, more than a hundred Bay Area residents had lined up to catch a whiff of its elusive scent, which the plant only exudes when it blossoms.Though scientists estimate there are fewer than 1,000 corpse flowers in the wild, the Bay Area boasts several in protected environments, which has allowed residents to catch a stinky bloom in both 2022 and 2023
