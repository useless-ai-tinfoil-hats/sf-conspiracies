It’s a burger. It’s a salad. It’s the best of both worlds
-----
I used to work in a couple of different restaurants where burgers reigned supreme. At both spots, I had the glorious option to order a burger for staff meals — this felt like pure luxury because, like most people, I have a deep and abiding love for a good burger. We were serving up deliciously beefy, grass-fed patties seasoned just right to coax out those delightful umami notes. Sometimes that beef even had a hint of grassy flavor, which I can only assume was a quirky placebo effect.Pair
