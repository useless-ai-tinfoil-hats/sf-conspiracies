SF Giants' Brandon Crawford says goodbye in possible final game
-----
It may not be Brandon Crawford's final baseball game. But if it was, the best shortstop in Giants history had a grand San Francisco farewell.Crawford played at his usual perch at shortstop and went 0-for-4 in the final game of the season for the San Francisco Giants, which they lost 5-2 to the Dodgers. He was removed before the top of the ninth, tipping his cap to the San Francisco crowd several times and coming out for a curtain call.
In some ways, Sunday was just like any other
