For ‘Sing Sing,’ Colman Domingo turned to a fellow S.F. theater veteran to make movie magic
-----
Colman Domingo was feeling a little wistful. The Oscar-nominated actor was introducing his newest film, "Sing Sing," at the Alamo Drafthouse New Mission theater and recalled his decade as a San Francisco theater actor."My last San Francisco address was around the corner, at 22nd and Valencia," he told the crowd after last month's screening. "Above the Valencia Cyclery."
He's come a long way since leaving the city in 2001, carving a career that also includes an Emmy Award and a Tony
