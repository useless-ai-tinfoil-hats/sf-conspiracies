Oil companies violated California law on criminal background checks, lawsuit alleges
-----
A new lawsuit is accusing oil companies and their employment contractors of violating California's Fair Chance Act by automatically disqualifying job seekers based on their criminal records without conducting an individual assessment.The suit was filed in Los Angeles by a Black woman identified only as Jane Roe. She was convicted in 1993, at age 21, of charges that included conspiracy to commit armed robbery — based, she says, on "tampering with an ATM" — and was sentenced to 26½ years
