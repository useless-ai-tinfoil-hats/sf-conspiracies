This $20M S.F. luxury home faced ‘very unusual’ drop in price. What happened?
-----
A five-bedroom, 10,000-square-foot home in Russian Hill, just a block up from San Francisco's famous crooked stretch of Lombard Street, was listed for $20 million just over a year ago — the same price the owner paid for it in January 2020. But last month it sold for half that: just under $10 million.The 50% price drop for the home at 2626 Larkin St. was "very unusual," according to Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst for the Bay Area real estate group Compass.
