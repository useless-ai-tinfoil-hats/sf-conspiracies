The Chronicleâ€™s boys basketball regional players of the year
-----
San FranciscoZion Sensley (Riordan): The high-flying, often spectacular 6-foot-8 senior led the Crusaders to a historic undefeated West Catholic Athletic League and Central Coast Section Open Division crown while averaging 17.5 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. A St. Mary's College signee, Sensley both made timely acrobatic dunks and difficult 3-point baskets at critical times for Riordan, which finished 25-5 and No. 2 in the Chronicle's rankings.
