Iâ€™m out $12K because of wage theft by my boss
-----
I found out about the San Francisco restaurant from my brother, who was supposed to work there but had another job. It was only going to be for one day but the owner asked if I could work all week. After that, she hired me and I started working regularly as a prep cook.At first, the owner was kind. But, after about a year of working with her, I noticed things changing. She would yell at me for nothing. There were times when I didn't receive my breaks.
Then, she stopped paying us.
