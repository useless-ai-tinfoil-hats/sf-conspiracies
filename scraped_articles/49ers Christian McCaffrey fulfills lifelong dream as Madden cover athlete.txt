Christian McCaffrey's big June became even bigger Tuesday.One week after signing a two-year, $38 million contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers, the running back landed another honor: McCaffrey will be on the cover of "Madden NFL 25." EA Sports made the announcement Tuesday morning, putting a 49ers player on the cover for the first time in 25 years (since Garrison Hearst).
McCaffrey also becomes the first running back in a decade to appear on the game cover.
