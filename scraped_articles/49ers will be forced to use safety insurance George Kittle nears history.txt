49ers will be forced to use safety insurance; George Kittle nears history
-----
The San Francisco 49ers will need to use the safety insurance they purchased earlier this month when they visit the Commanders on Sunday.Logan Ryan, 32, will make his first start since signing with the team on Dec. 5 because rookie safety Ji'Ayir Brown won't play at Washington due to a sprained knee. The 49ers added Ryan, an 11-year veteran with 121 career starts, after All-Pro safety Talanoa Hufanga suffered a torn ACL and backup George Odum suffered a torn biceps in November.
