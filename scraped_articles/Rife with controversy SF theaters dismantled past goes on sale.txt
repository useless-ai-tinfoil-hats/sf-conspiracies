For a few hundred dollars, you can now own one of San Francisco's historic — and contentious — pieces of furniture.The century-old Castro Theatre is selling its iconic red orchestra seats, giving members of the public the rare opportunity to buy a single for $349 or a pair for $499, it announced. The burgundy chairs can either be picked up in San Francisco from May 20 to 24 or delivered within 60 miles of the theater.
Proceeds go toward the theater's nonprofit partners, Oasis Arts
