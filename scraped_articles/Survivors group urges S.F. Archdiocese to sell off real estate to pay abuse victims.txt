Survivors group urges S.F. Archdiocese to sell off real estate to pay abuse victims
-----
A group of abuse survivors is challenging the Archdiocese of San Francisco's decision to declare bankruptcy, arguing it could instead sell parts of its multibillion-dollar real estate portfolio to compensate victims.More than 500 civil lawsuits have been filed against the archdiocese, accusing hundreds of religious leaders of sexual abuse. The archdiocese filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late August, claiming it was necessary to manage litigation and compensation for each of the cases.
