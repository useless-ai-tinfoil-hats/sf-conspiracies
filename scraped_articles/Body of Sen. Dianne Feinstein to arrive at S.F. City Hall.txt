Body of Sen. Dianne Feinstein to arrive at S.F. City Hall
-----
Early Wednesday morning, while San Francisco was starting its day, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein was expected to return to City Hall, the place she began her rise to political prominence.Feinstein died Friday in her Washington D.C. home at the age of 90 of natural causes. Her body was returned to San Francisco over the weekend on a military flight. Instead of lying in state in the U.S. Capitol, as many prominent senators have done, Feinstein's casket will sit beneath the City Hall dome.
