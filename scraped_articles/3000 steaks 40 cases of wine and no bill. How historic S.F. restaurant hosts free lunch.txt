No such thing as free lunch? John Konstin Sr., co-owner of classic downtown San Francisco restaurant John's Grill, would beg to differ. The business is celebrating its 115th birthday with a block party Wednesday, Oct. 4, at which John's will serve complimentary lunch to all comers.Konstin anticipates around 2,000 takers from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at 63 Ellis St. And he doesn't expect to run out of food, either. "We've got plenty of backup," he said.
