After A’s walk-off win, talk turns to a ‘last hurrah to the city of Oakland’
-----
Wouldn't it be stunning if the Oakland Athletics' final season at the Coliseum was remembered not just for owner John Fisher turning his back on the community?What if these A's were to be remembered for being a legitimate threat all summer? For competing in every series? For being … dare we say … fun to watch?
Nobody outside the A's clubhouse could have imagined such a long-shot scenario, but a funny thing is happening on the way to another 100-loss season: the A's are winning
