'The most glorious rampage': The Golden Gate Park bison were once known to escape
-----
Strolling along the edge of the Bison Paddock off JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park, you can watch the stately herd of animals grazing peacefully on grasses, rarely looking up from their task. They're hulking, slow beasts, completely unbothered by the scream of a toddler or a loud motorcycle riding past.But these animals, residents of Golden Gate Park for more than 100 years, have had their wild streak â€” escaping at least five documented times during their time in San Francisco.
