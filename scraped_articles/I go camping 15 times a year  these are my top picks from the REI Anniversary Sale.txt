I go camping 15 times a year â€” these are my top picks from the REI Anniversary Sale
-----
The 2024 REI Anniversary Sale has kicked off, and that means some of the best prices of the year are here for campers, hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts. As an avid camper myself who spends as many weekends outside as possible, I know a good deal on this stuff when I see it, and these prices make me want to load up on fresh gear. With tents, chairs, backpacks, clothing and more, chances are high you can find a deal on just about anything you need to take on the Great Outdoors.In
