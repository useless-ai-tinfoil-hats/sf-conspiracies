ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Skepticism is healthy for the next 5 Â½ weeks while Mars is traveling through Pisces. False hopes could lead to slippery missteps.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You're in no mood to give up something for nothing, but do it. Your goodwill gesture will come back to reward you by your birthday.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Revisiting an old matter isn't quite the can of worms you think. You have a unique opportunity to rectify a past mistake and should do it.
