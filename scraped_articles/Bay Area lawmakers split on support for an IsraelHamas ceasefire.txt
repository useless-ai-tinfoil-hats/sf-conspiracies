Bay Area lawmakers split on support for an Israel-Hamas cease-fire
-----
WASHINGTON — The future of the Israel-Hamas war is a rare dividing moment for Bay Area Democrats, with the majority of members supporting a humanitarian pause — the same effort being proposed by the White House — two who want a cease-fire, and four who didn't express support for either position.A humanitarian pause would be a temporary cease-fire in a limited area and with specific goals, while a cease-fire would be a longer-term stop in the fighting.
