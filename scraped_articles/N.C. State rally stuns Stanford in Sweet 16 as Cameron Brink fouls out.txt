N.C. State rally stuns Stanford in Sweet 16 as Cameron Brink fouls out
-----
PORTLAND, Ore. â€” Just a minute into the fourth quarter, North Carolina State's Aziaha James loaded up for an NBA-length 3-pointer, fired and flashed three fingers to the crowd before it even landed in the net.That was when No. 3 seed N.C. State took the air out of No. 2 Stanford for good, less than a minute before Cameron Brink fouled out of her last college game, and nine minutes before the Wolfpack sent Stanford packing with a 77-67 Sweet 16 defeat on Friday night.
