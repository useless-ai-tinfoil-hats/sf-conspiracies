Carol Doda was no feminist pioneer. She was something else altogether
-----
I met Carol Doda on my second night in San Francisco.It was 1985, and I was interviewing for a job at the Chronicle (this one, the one I still have). As part of the process, I was sent out to do an assignment in the North Beach neighborhood. At first I thought I'd write about "Beach Blanket Babylon," the famed musical revue, but I didn't catch any of the San Francisco references. It was just a bunch of big hats as far as I was concerned.
So instead I wandered into the Condor Club
