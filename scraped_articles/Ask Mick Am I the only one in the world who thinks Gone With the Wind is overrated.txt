Dear Mick: Thank you for your review of "The Creator." That movie was nuts, and I like your description of it being propaganda for AI. It was what I needed to hear. I am down here in Australia and was shocked at how anti-civilization it was.Liz Bryant, Australia
Dear Liz: If a movie is trying to sell ideas that are completely nuts, there's no need for critics to feel squeamish about noticing. In terms of its message, "The Creator" is poisonous, a movie that chooses machines over
