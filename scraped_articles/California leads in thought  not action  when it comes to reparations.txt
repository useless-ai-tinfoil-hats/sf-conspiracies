California leads in thought — not action — when it comes to reparations
-----
The day before this year's Black History Month began, a group of powerful Black California lawmakers got the whole country talking about reparations. They proposed 14 bills seeking to address issues like food insecurity, hair discrimination in competitive sports and racist property seizures, among other things.These Black leaders had an opportunity to be courageous and make one of their bills about cash payments, but they didn't. This wasn't an unfortunate oversight — it was intentional.
