It's June in San Francisco: Time for the city's midterm test
-----
Summer came in with the fog just before 2 in the afternoon Thursday. Did you notice? It was the solstice, the official changing of the seasons, the longest daylight of the year: sunrise at 5:48, sunset at 8:34. The next day was slightly shorter, as are the days after that until December. The year is half over.The sun barely shone in San Francisco on the longest day. That's the kind of year it has been: neither one thing or the other. A kind of half-baked year. Think of 2024 as a semester
