The Sacramento Zoo is pulling out of the city. It leaves behind a century of history.
-----
Earlier this month, the Sacramento Zoo announced it is officially leaving for Elk Grove, ending nearly a century in the same spot. When the animals are packed up and moved down Highway 99, a chapter will close on California zoological history.The first version of the zoo opened in Land Park, a public space gifted to the city by former Sacramento Mayor William Land. It wasn't a trip around the world for the animals on show: Most were California wildlife like deer, porcupines and raccoons.
