Mason Miller’s surprise return helps A’s complete winning homestand
-----
A meager matinee crowd of 3,871 at the Coliseum on Wednesday was treated to a surprise performance and witnessed something the Oakland Athletics had accomplished only once this season: a winning homestand.A's right-hander Mason Miller made his return to the mound, throwing two perfect innings in the A's 5-2 defeat of Toronto. The appearance didn't mirror Miller's first MLB stint early on this season, when he made four strong starts to solidify himself as a rotation piece of the future.
