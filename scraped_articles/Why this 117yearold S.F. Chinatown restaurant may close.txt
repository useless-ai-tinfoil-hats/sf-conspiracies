Why this 117-year-old S.F. Chinatown restaurant may close
-----
Sam Wo, one of the most venerable restaurants in San Francisco's Chinatown, could be closing.Co-owner David Jitong Ho plans to step away from the 117-year-old business at 713 Clay St., first reported by the SF Standard. If he doesn't find a new owner by January 2025, when the lease expires, the restaurant will have to close, said co-owner Steven Lee.
"Were not giving up yet, but it's a struggle to find the right replacement," Lee told the Chronicle.
