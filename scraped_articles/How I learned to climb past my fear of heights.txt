How I learned to climb past my fear of heights
-----
Until I turned 40, I suffered from altophobia, a fear of heights. I wouldn't even sit in the balcony of a theater. Our friend Tim was still alive then, so for my birthday, he gifted me a cure.Quoting Eleanor Roosevelt — "You must do the thing you cannot do" — we drove to Hollister, climbed into a plane, flew to an altitude of 17,000 feet and jumped out. Thanks to good parachutes, we survived, and heights never bothered me again.
Until tragedy struck.
