-----
Hawaii is a culinary wonderland, and the islands can compete with the best of the best when it comes to restaurants. No one, perhaps other than Anthony Bourdain, was as good at highlighting the places where the locals eat as Guy Fieri on his hit TV show "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."Over the course of 39 seasons (and counting), Fieri has highlighted over 40 restaurants and eateries across the state. Here are some highlights picked out by the SFGATE staff.
