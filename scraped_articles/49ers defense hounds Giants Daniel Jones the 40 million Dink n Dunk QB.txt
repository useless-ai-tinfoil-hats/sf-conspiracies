49ers’ defense hounds Giants’ Daniel Jones, the $40 million Dink ’n Dunk QB
-----
Coming into Thursday night's game at Levi's Stadium, the San Francisco 49ers' defenders hoped that Daniel Jones, the New York Giants' well-compensated quarterback, would launch an aggressive aerial assault. They were seeking interceptions and strip sacks and a chance to show a national audience what happens when an overrated passer gets over his skis.The 49ers wanted dimes aplenty from "Danny Dimes." A few series into Thursday's game, they realized they were getting Danny Dink-'n-Dunk.
