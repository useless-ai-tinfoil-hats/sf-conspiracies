Earthquake gives Bay Area a shake on Saturday morning
-----
An earthquake gave parts of the Bay Area a firm rattle late Saturday morning.The quake hit at 11:12 a.m. and had a preliminary magnitude of 3.4, which could change as the U.S. Geological Survey gets more precise data. The epicenter was about 9.4 kilometers deep near Garber Park along the Berkeley-Oakland border. The shake was widely felt in the East Bay, but people in San Francisco, in the North Bay and as far away as San Jose reported feeling it as well on USGS' self-reported data page.
