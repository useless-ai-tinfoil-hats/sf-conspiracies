After a decade of Cajun food, this Bay Area restaurant has closed
-----
Easy Creole, a Berkeley favorite for shrimp etouffee, hot links and other Louisiana-style dishes has closed.Owners announced the closure of the business at 1761 Alcatraz Ave. on their website and in a message on Instagram Tuesday. They had hoped to sell the restaurant, they said, but the party interested in taking over has not finalized the deal.
"If you want more Easy demand the new folks finish purchasing it and open it up for you to enjoy," reads the post on their website.
