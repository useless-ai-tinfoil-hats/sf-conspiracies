49ers likely to keep Jauan Jennings after using tender on No. 3 receiver
-----
One of the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl standouts is almost certainly staying in Santa Clara.On Monday, the 49ers placed a second-round tender on wide receiver Jauan Jennings, who was a restricted free agent. The second-round tender carries a one-year, $4.89 million salary and gives the 49ers the right to match a better offer Jennings might accept from another team. If the 49ers didn't match, that team would have to surrender a second-round pick to the 49ers.
It's highly
