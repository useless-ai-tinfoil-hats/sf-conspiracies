-----
On the evening of March 18, a usually busy West Portal intersection was unusually quiet.The street was closed to hold the vigil for Diego Cardoso de Oliveira, Matilde Moncado Ramos Pinto and their two young children, the San Francisco family killed after being hit by the driver of a speeding sport-utility vehicle just two days earlier.
Despite hundreds of people filling the street in front of the public library branch, you could hear the sound of the Muni train on West Portal
