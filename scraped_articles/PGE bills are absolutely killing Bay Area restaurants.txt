PG&E bills are absolutely killing Bay Area restaurants
-----
Every time Oakland restaurateur Geoff Davis looks at his PG&E bill, he feels helpless."I talk about it a lot with my friends. It's a big line item for us," the chef-owner of Burdell told SFGATE. "Last month [PG&E] was like 40% of our rent. It's an insane amount and obviously this is my first time being an owner, but I know from other places that I've worked that it wasn't this big of a number."
It's an expensive time to run a restaurant â€” or to eat at one. Increased food and labor
