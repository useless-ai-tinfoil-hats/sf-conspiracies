How virtual reality can help us feel and understand forgotten horrors
-----
I was more than a little startled when Konrad Adenauer approached me in the Old Market.Sure, I was visiting Cologne, Germany, Adenauer's hometown. But I had never imagined I'd lay eyes on the German republic's first post-war chancellor â€” much less get a wave from him.
Not least because he died six years before I was born.
But I had traveled back to 1926, when Adenauer was Cologne's mayor, courtesy of TimeRide, a virtual reality tour.
I'm not much for tourist
