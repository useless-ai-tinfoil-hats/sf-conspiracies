Fire alarm gives 49ers early wakeup call, another Super Bowl week annoyance
-----
The San Francisco 49ers received an unexpected early wake-up call Thursday when a fire alarm went off at their hotel.According to a loss-prevention officer at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa, about 6 miles east of the city, the alarm went off about 6 a.m. and was silenced after roughly 10 minutes. Guests didn't have to leave their rooms because "engineering was able to deduce it was a false alarm and there was no evacuation needed," the hotel employee said.
