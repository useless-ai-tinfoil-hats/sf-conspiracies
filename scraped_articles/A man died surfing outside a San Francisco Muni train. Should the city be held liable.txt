A man died ‘surfing’ outside a San Francisco Muni train. Should the city be held liable?
-----
Since 2015, San Francisco has logged at least 46 reports of a high-risk mode of travel: people hitching rides on the hooks of Muni train cars.The number surfaced in a lawsuit brought by the mother of a man who died after tucking himself between two cars of an out-of-service train. Surveillance video showed Todd Odnamar sitting on the coupler device apparently without holding on, his arms wrapped in his T-shirt. As the train coasted toward the rail yard, he fell off.
