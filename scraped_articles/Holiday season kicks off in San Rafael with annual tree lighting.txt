Holiday season kicks off in San Rafael with annual tree lighting
-----
Kids danced in the streets and their parents snacked on holiday treats Saturday night as San Rafael residents gathered to watch the city light its holiday tree.The annual Holiday of Lights & Winter Wonderland event drew crowds to a shut-down section of Fourth Street, where residents browsed through local businesses and vendors lining the street in white tents. At the intersection of Fourth and Court Street, a tall tree towered over the crowd, waiting to be lit.
