Despite flaming out in the first round of the playoffs this year, the Eagles still found a way to make their mark on the Super Bowl via a noted 49ers antagonist.Philadelphia's head of security, Dom "Big Dom" DiSandro, was spotted at Sunday's game. DiSandro made national headlines this past regular season when he shoved San Francisco linebacker Dre Greenlaw during a sideline scuffle. In response, Greenlaw took a swipe at the Eagles staffer. Both men were tossed from the Dec. 3 matchup.
