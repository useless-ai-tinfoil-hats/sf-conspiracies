Please, MLB, donâ€™t turn historic Rickwood Field into baseball Disneyland
-----
A gondola ride along the canals of Venice, Italy, is a romantic experience. It would kill the romantic and historic vibe, in my opinion, if the gondolier fired up a big outboard motor and instead of singing, cranked up a boom box playing Dean Martin's greatest hits.The point is: Romantic history and tradition must be cherished, not trampled.
So, please, Major League Baseball, don't schlock up Rickwood Field for the June 20 game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis
