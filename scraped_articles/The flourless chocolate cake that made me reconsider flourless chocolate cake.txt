The quintessential flourless chocolate cake, to my mind, is dense and fudgy. Perhaps there's some almond meal in there, amping up the marzipan-like texture, or maybe it's served slightly underbaked, a molten core contrasting with squidgy edges. If it's the '90s, there is raspberry coulis.But the Gâteau Victoire at Zuni Café is entirely different, more a souffle than a brownie. It's chocolate foam. It's in your mouth, and then it's not, the bittersweet residue of 61% Guittard bouncing
