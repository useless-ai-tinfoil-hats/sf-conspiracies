Editor's note: Online inventory may sell out fast, so check to see if you can buy the item from your local Walmart store online and then pick it up.Black Friday is known as the day to score a new TV at a steep discount. Earlier this week, Walmart dropped a 65-inch TCL 4k smart TV for $228 — and, unsurprisingly, it sold out in hours. However, there's still plenty of great TV deals to check out, including a massive 83-inch Sony model that's over $2,000 off today.
