Letters: Here’s what the NFL should do about Harrison Butker’s commencement speech
-----
Regarding "Why the NFL dumped Colin Kaepernick but won't do squat to Harrison Butker" (Scott Ostler, SFChronicle.com, May 15): So, now we learn that Scott Ostler is not a fan of the First Amendment even though it is what his entire career has been based upon.What did Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker say that got Ostler and his left-minded troupers in such as lather? Speak his mind? Offer an opinion they didn't care for? How dare Butker not follow the game plan of others.
