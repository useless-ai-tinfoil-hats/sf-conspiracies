Letters: Why getting more young people to vote is important for democracy
-----
Lack of civic engagement among young people is a prevalent issue. Less than 50% of eligible voters ages 18 to 29 vote, and this is the lowest voter participation for any age group.This is largely because the process of voting can feel unfamiliar and complicated to a new voter.
College campuses aren't doing enough to make voting accessible to their students. Long lines, distant ballot boxes, and confusing deadlines deter eligible voters from making their voices heard.
