Entire private island in the San Francisco Bay lists for $75 million
-----
An entire private island in the San Francisco Bay has hit the market for $75 million.Point Buckler's 50 acres of swampy marshland on the southern edge of Grizzly Bay in Solano County last changed hands for just $150,000 in 2011. The huge price hike may have something to do with the recent $800 million land grab by Flannery Associates â€” the group of ultra-wealthy Silicon Valley tech moguls who are controversially trying to build a brand new city outside Fairfield.
