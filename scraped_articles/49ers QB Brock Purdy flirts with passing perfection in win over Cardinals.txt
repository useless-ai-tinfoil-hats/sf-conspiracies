49ers QB Brock Purdy flirts with passing perfection in win over Cardinals
-----
After Sunday's 19-point win over the Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy was "mad" about a seemingly innocuous play: In the third quarter, on 3rd-and-24 from Arizona's 46-yard line, he threw a short sideline pass at running back Christian McCaffrey's feet â€¦ for an incompletion.Instead of being in position to attempt a long field goal, Purdy noted his mistake meant the 49ers were forced to punt in their 35-16 victory over the Cardinals.
