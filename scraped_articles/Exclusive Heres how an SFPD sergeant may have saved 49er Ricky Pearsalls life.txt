Exclusive: Here’s how an SFPD sergeant may have saved 49er Ricky Pearsall’s life
-----
Sgt. Joelle Harrell was standing near the corner of Grant and Post just before 4 p.m. on Saturday when she heard three pops about a block south of her. For a moment, she wondered if it was the skateboarders who often frequent Maiden Lane — but the noise was too loud.She started running south toward Geary and called out over the radio that she was going to investigate possible gunshots nearby.
As she passed Maiden Lane, she looked left, and right.
No skateboarders.
