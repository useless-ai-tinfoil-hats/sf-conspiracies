'Turn over one more rock': The San Francisco disappearance of Kristen Modafferi
-----
Meghan Modafferi has a memory from when she was 7 years old. She was walking the streets of San Francisco, handing out flyers to strangers, trying to find her big sister. She remembers her family went to Kinko's to make more copies of missing posters with her sister's face on them. While they waited, she wandered over to a big blue mailbox."I had a favorite stuffed animal," Meghan said, "and I put it in a mailbox, and I closed it, and it disappeared. I was so upset."
