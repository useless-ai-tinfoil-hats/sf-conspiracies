A meal at the Vegas buffet with nearly 15,000 Yelp reviews
-----
When the Bacchanal first opened in 2012, it billed itself as "the new standard for the Las Vegas buffet." Over a decade later, it has accrued nearly 15,000 Yelp reviews, making it one of the most-rated restaurants on Earth. With nine kitchens, 25,000 square feet and seating for some 600 guests, on busy days thousands of people can pass through the most famous restaurant in Caesars Palace. As its name suggests, the Bacchanal is the first and last name in excess. It is the Super Bowl of buffets.
