Jurickson Profarâ€™s slam off Keaton Winn all Padres need to beat Giants 4-0
-----
The spirit, exuberance and winning vibes that were experienced during Friday's home opener didn't carry over for the San Francisco Giants, who found themselves in a massive hole moments after the first pitch on a cool Saturday evening at Oracle Park.It was the second straight sellout, but before many fans found their seats, the Giants trailed 4-0, a score that didn't change the rest of the night as the San Diego Padres evened the weekend series at a game apiece.
Jurickson Profar,
