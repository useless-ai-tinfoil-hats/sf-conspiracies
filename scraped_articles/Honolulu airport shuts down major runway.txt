Honolulu airport shuts down major runway
-----
The international airports in San Francisco and Honolulu are an ocean apart, but both are afflicted by ongoing runway woes just as summer travel to Hawaii begins.This week, the Hawaii Department of Transportation closed 4R-22L, one of the major runways at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, to repave the tarmac's shoulder and update drainage to current standards. The department wrote in a statement that the 9,000-foot runway will be closed through June 7.
