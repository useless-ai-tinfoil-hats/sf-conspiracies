The tiny Calif. state park foreshadowing Joshua Tree National Park's future

Though I was only minutes away from one of Los Angeles County's biggest suburban cities, the high desert trail I was on felt very similar to Joshua Tree National Park. Twisted and gangly branches sprawled out of towering, protected Joshua trees. The desert smell of creosote bushes filled the air, and the dusty ground was spotted with purple verbena and ivory primrose.There were a few key differences between the famous desert national park and this parched stretch of land near Lancaster.
