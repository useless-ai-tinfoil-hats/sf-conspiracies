Jaydn Ott confident Cal can beat Auburn in Bears' bid to upset SEC foe
-----
Anyone portraying the matchup at Memorial Stadium on Saturday night as underdog Cal against a big, bad opponent from the SEC, Auburn, should alter that perception. That's the opinion of Cal running back Jaydn Ott."I just want to get that into my guys' heads," Ott said Wednesday. "A name doesn't mean anything. At the end of the day, they're still human, and we have just as much of a chance as they do to go in there and get the win."
Ott helped the Bears get a 58-21 win at North
