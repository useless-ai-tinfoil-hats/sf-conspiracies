Fewer San Francisco homes sold in 2023 than any other year since at least 2005, with mortgage rate hikes and shifting buyer trends cooling the city's market.About 4,130 homes sold in San Francisco last year, according to a report from real estate company Compass. That count, which includes houses and condominiums, was the lowest of any year in the company's data, which stretches back to 2005. The next-lowest total was in 2009, during the mortgage crisis, when roughly 4,645 homes sold.
