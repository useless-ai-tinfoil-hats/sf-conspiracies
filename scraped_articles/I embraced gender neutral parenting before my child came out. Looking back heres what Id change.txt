I embraced gender neutral parenting before my child came out. Looking back, here’s what I’d change
-----
Skylar was born a girl, meaning they were assigned female at birth by their doctors. Today, Skylar identifies as male. Their preferred pronouns are he/him or they/them.Up until a few years ago, they were, in my mind, unequivocally my daughter. Long hair and pretty dresses were their thing, but so were hunting for bugs, dreaming of dinosaurs, and digging in the dirt. I didn't expect Skylar to play with dolls, or for them to be a princess on Halloween when they preferred Legos and Dracula
