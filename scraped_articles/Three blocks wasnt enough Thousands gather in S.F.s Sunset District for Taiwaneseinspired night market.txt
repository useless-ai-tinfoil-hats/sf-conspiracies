Three years ago it may have been impossible to imagine three blocks of Irving Street packed to the brim with people, performers and food.But the inaugural Sunset Night Market held Friday night was just as crowded as the night markets of Taipei it was inspired by.
From 20th Avenue to 23rd, every corner brought a new experience: from Taiwanese pork cutlet sandwiches to a dozen purple tutu-ed ballerinas waiting for their performance with the San Francisco Youth Ballet Academy.
