Tragedy and tranquility at this Bay Area mountaintop escape
-----
As luck would have it, the evening I drove up the eastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais to stay at the iconic peak's historic hotel was also a blue moon. As I arrived, diners and drinkers on the old redwood deck looking out over the forests of Marin watched the rare moon rise from one of the best vantage points around. And the serendipity didn't end there. Serenading the crowd was a man named Wolff, who didn't quite howl at the moon but instead sang pretty Neil Young covers into the twilight.
