Horoscope for Monday, 03/11/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): It's time to stop rewriting history and to learn from the past. Have an open mind and heart and you'll see yourself go from intermediate to advanced.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Ruling planet Venus enters Pisces. Careful what you wish for today because hooking a big fish is one thing, but reeling it in is another.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): One option looks as good as the other so close your eyes and choose. It will prove to be a lot quicker than trying
