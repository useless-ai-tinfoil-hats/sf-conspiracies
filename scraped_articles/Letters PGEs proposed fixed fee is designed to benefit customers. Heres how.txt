Regarding "Here's the real reason PG&E rates are skyrocketing in California" (Open Forum, SFChronicle.com, April 21): Loretta Lynch's comments on the fixed charge proceedings at the California Public Utilities Commission are an unfortunate misrepresentation of the debate.The fixed charge is not "on top of" per-kilowatt-hour prices but rather explicitly designed to be offset by lower per-kWh prices. The fixed fee is not the "start of more rate increases" because it is not a rate increase
