Stanford canâ€™t find second-half magic against UCLA, absorbs 42-7 drubbing
-----
Trailing by more than 20 points at halftime isn't exactly the optimal way to try to win a football game. Stanford was able to overcome such a deficit at Colorado on Oct. 13, but didn't come close to repeating that feat against No. 25 UCLA at Stanford Stadium on Saturday night.The Bruins led 21-0 at halftime and weren't threatened in the second half as they cruised to a 42-7 victory.
Stanford (2-5, 1-4 Pac-12) overcame a 29-0 deficit to stun the Buffaloes 46-43 in double overtime
