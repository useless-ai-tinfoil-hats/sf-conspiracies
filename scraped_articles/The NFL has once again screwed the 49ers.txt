The NFL has once again screwed the 49ers
-----
For the second straight year, the San Francisco 49ers got hosed by the NFL's schedule makers.Last year, no team in the league had a greater net rest disparity compared to their opponents (-20) than the Niners, who were also the only team to play a game with a -8 rest disparity: a Week 8 game against the Bengals where the Niners were coming off a Monday night game and the Bengals were coming off a bye. San Francisco lost that contest 31-17.
This year, the Niners will face four teams
