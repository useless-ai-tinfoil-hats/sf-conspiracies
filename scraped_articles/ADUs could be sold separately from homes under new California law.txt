ADUs could be sold separately from homes under new California law
-----
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two bills Wednesday that will boost the construction of ADUs, or accessory dwelling units â€” the latest effort to address the state's housing crisis.AB1033, introduced by Assembly Member Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, allows cities to decide whether property owners can sell ADUs as condos, separate from homes. The bill repeals an existing law that prohibits separate sales of ADUs and will allow homeowners to get loans to build them, as opposed to repaying loans
