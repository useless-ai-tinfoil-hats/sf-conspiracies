‘The fire department will not be able to stop it’: Berkeley fire chief’s sobering message about risk of 1923-like inferno
-----
On Sept. 17, 1923, a wildfire driven by strong winds raced into north Berkeley neighborhoods from the hills behind the university. As the outmatched young fire department called for help, thousands of UC students sprang into action, and San Francisco firefighters drove engines onto barges and rushed across the bay. The inferno would eventually destroy a 50-square-block area with more than 600 homes, though miraculously no one was reported to have died in the flames.One hundred years
