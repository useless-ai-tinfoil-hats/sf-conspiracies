What are the big issues for in-limbo A's as training camp opens this week?
-----
Many teams — most teams — will have more talent than the Oakland A's when pitchers and catchers report to camp Wednesday.The A's, though, might lead the league when it comes to sheer can't-look-away fascination. Will Oakland draw fans this spring, given the boycotts planned by fans for what, right now, appears to be the A's last season at the Coliseum? Will there be any major developments about where they'll play in the next few years? Is the Las Vegas plan showing some cracks?
