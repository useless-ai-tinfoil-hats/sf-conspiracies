UPDATE: Kaiser to lay off dozens of workers in Bay Area, Southern CaliforniaCecilia Lopez, a medical assistant at Kaiser in Oakland, has worked at the health care giant for less than a year but said it didn't take long to see why her colleagues were burned out.
"I've definitely seen the impact being short-staffed has had on morale and patient care," Lopez said Friday, while picketing down the street from her workplace carrying a sign that read, "Kaiser workers won't be silenced."
