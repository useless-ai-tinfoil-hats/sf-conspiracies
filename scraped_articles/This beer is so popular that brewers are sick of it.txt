We're deep in a beer haze over here. Today we published our annual update to the Top Bay Area Breweries guide, with some new additions like Dokkaebier, a Korea-inspired Oakland brewery that uses kimchi, lemongrass and other fun ingredients. SF Beer Week begins Friday, Feb. 9, with a full calendar of events lasting through the 18th. And of course, on Sunday we'll be observing the most beer-centric holiday of the entire year, the Super Bowl.To anyone who, like me, has spent a lot of time
