Stanley's new Deco Collection includes 5 new tumbler colors
-----
Social media cannot get enough of the Stanley Quencher tumbler. Everyone from TikTokers to Instagram influencers swear by the 40-ounce insulated cups, which sell out almost immediately when they're restocked, for helping them meet their hydration goals. If you haven't hopped on the bandwagon yet (or are bolstering your Quencher collection), Stanley just dropped its Deco Collection this week, which features its famous tumbler in gilded accents that give a nod to the glamorous Art Deco era.
