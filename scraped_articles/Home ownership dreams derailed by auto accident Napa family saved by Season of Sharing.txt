-----
This past January, life was looking up for Cristina Ramirez Gonzalez and her family of five.A longtime contract home health care worker, the Napa resident had just taken a full-time job at an assisted living facility. Her husband, Juan Carlos Hernandez Cortez, was racking up overtime at the wine and distribution warehouse where he had worked for five years, often putting in 12-hour days to build up savings. The couple's three kids, all under 10, were thriving in Napa public schools.
