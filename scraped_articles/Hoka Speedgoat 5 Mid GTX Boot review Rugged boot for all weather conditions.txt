Hoka Speedgoat 5 Mid GTX Boot review: Rugged boot for all weather conditions
-----
With the Hoka Speedgoat 5 Mid GTS boots, I've finally found a pair of all-weather hiking boots that are comfortable and supportive enough for multi-day treks. I love hiking, but I'm not as dedicated as some mountaineers. I tend to stick to fairly moderate half-day trips with plenty of snacks. I'm a distance runner, so I don't mind being on my feet, but I'm not crazy about lugging a loaded pack up a mountain face. That's partially because I didn't have a truly comfortable pair of hiking boots
