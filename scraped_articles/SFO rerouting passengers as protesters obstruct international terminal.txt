SFO 'rerouting passengers' as protesters obstruct international terminal
-----
Protesters flooded the international terminal and curb outside the San Francisco International Airport on Wednesday morning calling for a permanent cease-fire and waving a banner that said "Stop the world for Gaza."SFO alerted flyers just after 9 a.m. that there was protest activity in the international terminal. Footage on social media shows dozens of people, many wearing face masks, congregating in front of the terminal's A and G security gates.
