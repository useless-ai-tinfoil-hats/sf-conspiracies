Baseball has a hitting problem, but don't blame it all on A's Mason Miller
-----
What's wrong with baseball right now is that the hitters are not hitting the baseball.I blame it on Mason Miller, who strikes out so many guys that he drags down MLB's hitting stats. Miller is hurling the ball so hard that he's even messing up the timing of hitters who only see him on TV or hear about him.
OK, so maybe the entire blame isn't on Miller, the Oakland Athletics' K-crazy closer. But something is wrong with the hitters.
Last season, teams averaged 4.62 runs, 8.5
