Ed Sheeran drops by In-N-Out after California show, helps out behind the counter
-----
He may be from the other side of the pond, but Ed Sheeran's evening of going to Dodger Stadium and stopping at In-N-Out on the way home was about as classically Southern California as you can get.On Thursday, the "Shape of You" singer posted a 40-second Instagram video, with the caption "after show burger life" chronicling his late night In-N-Out trip.
Sheeran proved he wasn't an In-N-Out novice by chanting "double-double" on his way in and ordering his cheeseburger "animal style."
