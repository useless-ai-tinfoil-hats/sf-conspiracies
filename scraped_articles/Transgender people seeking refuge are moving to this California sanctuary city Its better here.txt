Transgender people seeking refuge are moving to this California sanctuary city: ‘It’s better here’
-----
Ethos de Leon considers themselves a refugee in their own country.Three years ago, de Leon said, they moved to Sacramento from Colorado, a state where, outside the liberal hub of Denver, transgender people are often not welcomed.
"I was experiencing transphobia every day, and I came here to Sacramento for protection, because I know California is the only safe place for us to exist in this country," de Leon said. "I'm a refugee from this anti-trans world we live in."
