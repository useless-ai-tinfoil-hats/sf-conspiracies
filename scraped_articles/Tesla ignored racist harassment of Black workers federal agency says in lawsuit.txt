Tesla ignored racist harassment of Black workers, federal agency says in lawsuit
-----
A federal civil rights agency sued Tesla on Thursday for its treatment of Black workers at its Fremont assembly plant, saying Elon Musk's electric car company has ignored longstanding and well-documented complaints of racist name-calling, harassment and retaliation.Since at least May 2015, Tesla has subjected Black employees to "a hostile work environment because of their race," the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in a filing in San Francisco federal court.
