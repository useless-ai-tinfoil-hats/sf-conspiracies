A massive murder of crows has descended on Oakland. Here’s what’s happening
-----
A couple of weeks ago, I was having dinner with a friend in uptown Oakland when a slow but steady increase in noise started to drown out our conversation. We looked out the window and saw the sky outside the restaurant had turned black with the beating wings of crows. As we settled our bill, the birds kept coming. When we walked outside, the cacophony was deafening. Hundreds of crows filled the trees, sat on the telephone poles and lined the edges of buildings.Passersby paused to stare.
