Horoscope for Thursday, 06/20/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): The problem with a Sun/Neptune square is that people really do believe what they're saying no matter how absurd their claims. This applies to loved ones as well as UFO conspiracy theorists.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): The more you give, the more you will get in return â€“ but you have to give first.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Arrangements made around the 12th come undone. Whether it's an inconvenience or a blessing depends on what comes to light today.
