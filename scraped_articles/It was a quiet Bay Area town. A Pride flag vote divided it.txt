It was a quiet Bay Area town. A Pride flag vote divided it

At the start of the year, when atmospheric rivers were dumping record-breaking rain across the Bay Area, water rushed down Kilkare Canyon, overflowing the banks of Sinbad Creek until finally flooding the Sunol Glen School.Residents rallied, packing sandbags around vulnerable buildings and later shoveling out the sludge and rock and other detritus that had been deposited around the nearly century-old schoolhouse.
It was the kind of moment that defines and bolsters a community.
