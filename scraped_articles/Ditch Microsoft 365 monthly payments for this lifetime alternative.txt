Ditch Microsoft 365 monthly payments for this lifetime alternative
-----
At first, a Microsoft 365 subscription can feel pretty cheap. What's a few bucks every month for software you use every day? The only problem is that if you're always paying for something, you never actually own it. Microsoft 365 is a great way to rent your productivity.If you want reliable software you don't have to budget for, go for a classic: Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2019 is still only $26.97, and that's for a lifetime license. No subscription. No fees. You buy it, and it's yours.
