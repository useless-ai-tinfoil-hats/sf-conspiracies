Will playing for 49ers mark a turnaround for pass rusher Randy Gregory?
-----
When Randy Gregory was asked this week whether he had a pre-draft visit with the San Francisco 49ers before he was selected in the second round in 2015, the pass rusher was candid: He didn't recall, but the odds are great that he spent time in Santa Clara.NFL teams can bring 30 prospects in for visits, and they often use them on players with off-the-field question marks that require vetting.
Said Gregory: "I went to about 29 teams."
