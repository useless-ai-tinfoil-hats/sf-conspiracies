Can Cal rediscover its defense when Bears play at No. 16 Utah?
-----
When Kyle Whittingham was asked Monday about Cal's defense, part of the Utah head coach's answer would be considered almost boilerplate for any opponent of the Bears for the past 6Â½ seasons."Coach Wilcox is a really good defensive coach. That's his forte," Whittingham said. "You know you're always going to get sound schemes and fundamentals and technique out of teams that he coaches."
Since Wilcox became Cal's head coach in 2017, the Bears have been known mainly for their defense.
