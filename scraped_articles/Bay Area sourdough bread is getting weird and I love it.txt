What do chocolate, gochujang, lemon zest, squid ink, ube, miso, seaweed and carrot water all have in common?I know it reads like the recipe list for creating an invisibility potion, but this chaotic lineup of flavors is what you might find in your next loaf of sourdough. (Though not all togetherâ€¦ yet.)
