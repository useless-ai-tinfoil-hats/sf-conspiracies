Bachelor Nation’s Clayton Echard wins paternity case against San Francisco radio host’s daughter
-----
Former "Bachelor" TV star Clayton Echard is relieved that an Arizona court has ruled in his favor in a paternity case filed by a woman with San Francisco ties, but said he knows the battle isn't over."I'm certainly grateful for the ruling, but still a little wary because we do need the county attorney to prosecute her so that she faces these charges," Echard told the Chronicle by phone Monday, June 24. "That would finally stop her from doing this again."
