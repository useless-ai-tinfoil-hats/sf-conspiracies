Keaton Winn rattled then rocked in return as Giants miss shot at sweeping Rangers
-----
ARLINGTON, Texas â€” Keaton Winn's first pitch back from injury couldn't have gone worse.His four-seam fastball swerved way up and in at Marcus Semien, hitting the Rangers' shortstop on his helmet's earflap hard enough to send that headgear flying off his head. Semien shook it off and took his base, but Winn was shaken. He walked the next batter and gave up a hard-hit single to load the bases for Wyatt Langford's two-run single up the middle, opening the scoring in what would become a 7-2
