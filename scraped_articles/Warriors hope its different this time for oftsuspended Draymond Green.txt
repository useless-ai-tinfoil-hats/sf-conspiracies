Warriors hope itâ€™s different this time for oft-suspended Draymond Green
-----
Do you believe him?Is it going to be different this time?
Draymond Green spoke to the media Tuesday, for the first time since returning to the Golden State Warriors from his indefinite suspension by the NBA. He was contrite. Sort of. He was definitely less defiant than in the past. He was introspective and unguarded.
"I've cost my team enough," the forward said. "I've cost this organization enough."
But will anything change? That's the question that will go unanswered
