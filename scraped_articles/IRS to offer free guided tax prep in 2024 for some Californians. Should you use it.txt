IRS to offer free, guided tax prep in 2024 for some Californians. Should you use it?
-----
Starting early next year, some Californians with relatively simple taxes will be able to prepare and file their federal tax return online directly with the Internal Revenue Service as part of a pilot project.After finishing their federal return, they will get a link to California's existing free e-filing program for state-tax returns, called CalFile. They can choose to use CalFile, or not.
The federal program, called Direct File, will be available on computers and mobile devices
