Exclusive: SFFilm’s 67th festival shorter but not lacking star power
-----
The San Francisco International Film Festival is the oldest such event in the Americas, but longtime observers will notice a couple of stark differences with the 67th edition next month.This year, after decades as an 11-day festival, SFFilm's main showcase has been reduced to five days, April 24-28, beginning with an opening-night presentation of Sean Wang's Sundance Film Festival prize-winning "DìDi," an ode to his childhood growing up in Fremont, SFFilm announced Wednesday, March 27.
