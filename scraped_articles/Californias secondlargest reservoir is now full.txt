California’s second-largest reservoir is now full
-----
Lake Oroville, the second-largest reservoir in California, reached capacity on Monday for a second straight year after another relatively wet winter.The rising waters come as state reservoir managers have been reducing outflows from the lake in recent weeks — as winter inflows tailed off and the threat of downstream flooding waned — allowing the reservoir to slowly fill to its current 899-foot elevation, or 3.52-million acre-feet of water.
