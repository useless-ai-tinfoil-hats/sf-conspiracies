49ers' Shanahan played end of half like a weak baby, got instant karma for it
-----
Kyle Shanahan's clock management to end the first half of the 49ers-Packers playoff game left many scratching their heads at how an ostensibly brilliant head coach bungled a clear scoring opportunity for his team.The 49ers' offense received the ball at their 25-yard line with 4:09 remaining in the first half after Green Bay cut San Francisco's lead to one point, 7-6. By 1:26 left in the second quarter, the Niners were at the Packers' 46-yard line with all three timeouts remaining.
