One of the brightest annual meteor showers will peak next weekend, and it's already causing a buzz in Southern California, with officials warning of a traffic surge to Joshua Tree National Park and its prime dark-sky vistas.But those in the Bay Area who are willing to stay up late — or get up very early — are also in for a celestial treat, astronomers say.
The Perseids, which occur each year from mid-July to late August, will peak from 11 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 11, to 3:30 a.m.
