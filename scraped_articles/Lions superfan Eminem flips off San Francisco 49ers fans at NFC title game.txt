Lions superfan Eminem flips off San Francisco 49ers fans at NFC title game
-----
With lyrics like "You think I give a fâ€”k? Come on, we're going for a ride, bitch, sit up front," Eminem's behavior at the NFC title game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions may not seem too surprising.Never one to shy away from profanity, the rapper appeared to flip off a sea of 49ers fans seated in front of his box at Levi's Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
It wasn't clear what, if anything, Niners fans said to the rapper to make him give them both middle fingers.
