I visited the Hawaii islet seen in 'Gilligan's Island'
-----
On the windward side of Oahu, in the blue waters of Kaneohe Bay, lies a little islet famous for its appearance on the classic TV show "Gilligan's Island," and you can take a two-hour tour of it.The 28-acre islet is covered in trees, including 400 coconut palms, and is owned by the University of Hawaii. It's used for marine research and offers walking tours to visitors who want to walk around it and learn about Moku o Loe's history and the marine studies being done there.
The beauty
