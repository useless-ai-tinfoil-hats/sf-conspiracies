More Dodgers fans than SF Giants fans expected on Ohtani's first trip to Oracle Park
-----
Starting Monday, the San Francisco Giants are hosting their archrivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time in the 2024 season. But the home team may be outnumbered in the stands.In the past two seasons, Giants-Dodgers games in San Francisco have seen a simultaneous decrease in Giants fans and an increase in Dodgers fans, as this reporter has seen in attending most of those games. And it seems like that will be the case again this series.
