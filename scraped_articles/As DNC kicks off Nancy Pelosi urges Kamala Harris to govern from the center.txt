As DNC kicks off, Nancy Pelosi urges Kamala Harris to govern ‘from the center’
-----
CHICAGO — While Republicans try to tag Vice President Kamala Harris as a "San Francisco radical," the San Franciscan who they've long attacked in the same way — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — urged Harris Monday to govern "from the center.""She knows governance has to be from the center in our country, and when she's putting forth her priorities, they have to be in a way that is unified," Pelosi said Monday after addressing 700 delegates and members of the California Democratic Party.
