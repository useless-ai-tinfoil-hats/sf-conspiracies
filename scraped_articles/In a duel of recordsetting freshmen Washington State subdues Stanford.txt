In a duel of record-setting freshmen, Washington State subdues Stanford
-----
Two freshmen guards from the Atlanta area put on quite a show at Maples Pavilion on Thursday night. And even though Kanaan Carlyle set a Stanford record for points in a game by a freshman, Washington State's Myles Rice got to enjoy the evening more than Carlyle did.That's because not only did Rice pour in a WSU freshman-record 35 points, but the Cougars did not trail and led by as many as 19 as they rolled the Cardinal 89-75.
Carlyle scored 31 points, breaking the school freshman
