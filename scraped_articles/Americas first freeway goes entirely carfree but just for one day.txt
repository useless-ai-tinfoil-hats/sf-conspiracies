America’s first freeway goes entirely car-free, but just for one day
-----
In the late 1930s, officials in Los Angeles and Pasadena, Calif. began work on a commuter road that would bridge the winding, often dry riverbed between the two booming cities. Dubbed the Arroyo Seco Parkway, the eight-mile stretch of asphalt and cement formally opened in 1940, becoming — by most accounts — the first-ever freeway in America.Now that same stretch — officially known as State Route 110, or the Pasadena Freeway — is going entirely car-free, at least for a few hours.
