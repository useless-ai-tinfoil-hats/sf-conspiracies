Outside Lands 2024: Daniel Caesar’s set cut off during first day of festival
-----
Daniel Caesar's microphone was shut off as he hit the city's curfew while closing out the first day of Outside Lands.The Canadian singer arrived on the Sutro Stage around 8:40 p.m. Friday, Aug. 9, as one of the last acts of the night. During his more than hour-long festival slot — part of which he performed veiled behind four walls of thin white fabric — he delivered a soulful set full with his R&B hits, from "Disillusioned" to "Get You" and "Best Part."
