The real stars of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' are Leonardo DiCaprio's fake teeth

I went to a screening of Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon" a week ago and have thought about it a great deal ever since. I think about the bodies. I think about Scorsese's camera exploring every square inch of the Osage Nation in the early 20th century: the mucky streets, packed houses, desolate jail cells. I think about Lily Gladstone's Mollie Burkhart wheezing, "You're next" to her husband while in a fit of delirium. I think about Robert De Niro's character's wire-rimmed glasses
