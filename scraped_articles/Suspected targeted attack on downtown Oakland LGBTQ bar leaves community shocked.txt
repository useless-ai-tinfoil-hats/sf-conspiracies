-----
The owners of a popular queer bar in downtown Oakland are reaching out for community support after their business was vandalized in what they suspect to be a targeted attack.Port Bar co-owner Sean Sullivan said he has been dealing with "extensive broken glass" after the bar's windows were shattered Wednesday morning. The bar was empty at the time, and no one appears to have entered the building, he added.
"We were targeted. This is not a smash and grab," Sullivan told SFGATE.
