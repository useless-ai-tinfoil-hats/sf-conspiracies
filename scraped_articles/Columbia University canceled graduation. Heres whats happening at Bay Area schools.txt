-----
As colleges head to graduation day amid widespread unrest on campuses across the country, UC Berkeley, Stanford and other Bay Area universities with active protests against Israel's war in Gaza have so far steered clear of the mass arrests and civil disobedience at other schools.On Monday, Columbia University canceled its graduation ceremony and said it will hold smaller events for each of its colleges, away from its main campus that has been the center of protests and conflict.
