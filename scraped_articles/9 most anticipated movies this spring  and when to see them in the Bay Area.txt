9 most anticipated movies this spring â€” and when to see them in the Bay Area
-----
The spring movie season is my favorite of the year.I'm not crazy about the summer, with its bombardment of sci-fi and action movies, and the winter season (that is, January through the first week of March) is usually a dumping ground for odd movies. The fall and holiday seasons are when most of the prestige films are released, but spring is the time for weird, interesting movies that maybe are too small to compete with the summer blockbusters and the end-of-year Oscar bait.
