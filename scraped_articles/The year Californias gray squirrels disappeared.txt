The year California's gray squirrels disappeared
-----
One day, the squirrels of California disappeared.It happened so quietly that, at first, no one really noticed. But by 1922, Californians were looking around and wondering: Where did all the squirrels go?
There are few native species quite like the western gray squirrel. With their voluminous tails, curious faces and white bellies, they've long been a favorite backyard visitor for Californians (unless, of course, you have a bird feeder in your yard). They were so sought-after that
