Sportswriter’s Olympic event? Walking 100 miles around Paris, and it’s not over yet
-----
PARIS — Woke up Thursday morning to a message from my iPhone, congratulating me on my activity level. I'm not an Olympic athlete, but hey, I'll take any praise I can get.The Olympics are always a walking event for journalists, who hoof it from one event to another, often circling venues more than once in search of our media entrance, dashing down from press tribunes to mixed zones for interviews and back up again.
The Paris Olympics, in particular, have been the Walking Games.
