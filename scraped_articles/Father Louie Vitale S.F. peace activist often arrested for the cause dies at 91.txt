Father Louie Vitale, S.F. peace activist often arrested for the cause, dies at 91
-----
In his weekly homily, Father Louie Vitale could not contain himself when he looked out upon his flock of the poor and distraught at St. Boniface Catholic Church in the Tenderloin.He'd smile and raise his hands and say, "It is just about love, all about love" to his audience, some of whom would be lying down in the pews asleep. These were his "brothers and sisters," and he spoke to them in English at the 8 a.m. sermon, and in Spanish at 10 a.m.
If Vitale did not have his hands
