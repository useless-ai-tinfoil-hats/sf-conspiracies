-----
Low stratus clouds and patchy drizzle will continue to hug the Bay Area coastline over the next couple of days, thanks to the reinvigorated marine layer. However, a bit of a switch-up is expected by Sunday and may continue into early next week as more sunshine may return to San Francisco.A coastal eddy has had an immense impact on Bay Area weather the past few days, spinning cool, moist air toward the Santa Cruz Mountains and the coastlines of San Mateo, San Francisco, Marin and Sonoma
