Warriors fall to Cavs; Draymond Green ejected after Donovan Mitchell dustup
-----
The Cavaliers appear to have a bead on this Golden State Warriors team, at least early this season. They defeated them for the second time this week on Saturday at Chase Center, this time cruising to a 118-110 victory in a game they led by 17 points.Saturday's matchup was the first in a back-to-back set for the Warriors following a grueling four-game road trip, which ended Wednesday night in Denver. Klay Thompson said fatigue was a factor in their sluggish performance against Cleveland.
