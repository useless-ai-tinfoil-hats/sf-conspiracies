Former Giant Pablo Sandoval signs with Staten Island FerryHawks
-----
Pablo Sandoval never said he was going to retire. He said he wanted to keep playing ball. His priority was to remain in the San Francisco Giants' organization and report to Triple-A Sacramento after spring training, but that always was a long shot because the front office preferred to give reps to younger players.So the Panda went elsewhere and on Saturday landed a roster spot with an independent team, the Staten Island FerryHawks of the Atlantic League.
"SIGNED," the team posted
