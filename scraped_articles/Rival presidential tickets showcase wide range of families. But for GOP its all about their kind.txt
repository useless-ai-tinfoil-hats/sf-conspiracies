Rival presidential tickets showcase wide range of families. But for GOP itâ€™s all about their kind
-----
With Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on board as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, the rival presidential tickets showcase an unusually wide range of families compared with the homogeneity of years past.But instead of celebrating this diversity, Republicans are prioritizing one kind of family with their policies: Heterosexual married couples with children.
The party that has long touted its support of family values should change its slogan to "one kind of family's values."
