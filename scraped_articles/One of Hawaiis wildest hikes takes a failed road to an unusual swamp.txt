One of Hawaii's wildest hikes takes a failed road to an unusual swamp

I am a long way from California.The path to Kauai's famous Alakai Swamp in Kokee State Park has gone from lumpy mud to steep climbs over tree roots to janky, overgrown boardwalks in a stretch of less than 4 miles. What I hoped would take an hour has extended into nearly three, and the electric-green ferns and twisting trees are starting to cast long shadows over the damp ground.
When the sun dips below the horizon, wild hogs with big, sharp tusks will likely begin to scavenge this
