A missing woman was discovered trapped in a gondola at Heavenly Ski Resort in Tahoe after a harrowing night in the cold. Monica Laso said she screamed herself hoarse as workers passed below her, unaware of her harrowing plight.Laso's nightmare began shortly before 5 p.m. Thursday. The woman had been snowboarding with friends, but she was ready to head down the mountain early. Laso told KCRA that a resort employee said she could take the gondola back down, so she hopped inside alone.
