A 40-year-old Bay Area bakery nearly vanished before it became a household name

Nothing is striking about the quiet stretch off Harbor Bay Parkway in Alameda, where a cluster of white and gray offices and warehouses dwell. Yet within the collection of buildings is a storied Bay Area bakery that's supplied dozens of local restaurants and grocery stores with crusty loaves of sweet baguettes and rustic sourdough for the past four decades.It's a busy morning at the Semifreddi's factory, where thousands of bread loaves are in different phases of the baking process.
