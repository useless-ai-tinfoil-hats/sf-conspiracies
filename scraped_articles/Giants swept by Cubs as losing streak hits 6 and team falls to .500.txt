Giants swept by Cubs as losing streak hits 6 and team falls to .500
-----
CHICAGO — September baseball. Nothing like it. That goes for teams sprinting to the Major League Baseball postseason and, on the flip side, for the San Francisco Giants, who are sprinting to their offseason hideaways.What began as a promising journey through San Diego and Chicago quickly turned into the Pall of Gloom Tour as August turned to September, a month that continues to haunt the Giants.
Wednesday's 8-2 loss to the Cubs left the Giants 0-6 in September — and at .500 (70-70)
