You have to eat with your hands at the Bay Areaâ€™s hottest food festival
-----
Last weekend in Napa, a carnival came to town. But this carnival didn't have games, rides or funnel cake.Instead, the main attraction was an overwhelming amount of meat.
For three consecutive nights, hundreds of spectators "oohed" and "aahed" over whole lamb smoked for 12 hours, then erupted in applause when a Bud Light was poured over it. They took out their phones to record the fiery torching of A5 Wagyu and marveled at the ingenuity of brisket stuffed into sweet monkey bread.
