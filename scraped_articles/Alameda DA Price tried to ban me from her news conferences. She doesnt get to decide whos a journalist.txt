Alameda DA Price tried to ban me from her news conferences. She doesn’t get to decide who’s a journalist
-----
Earlier this month, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price turned me away from a news conference, a clear violation of my First Amendment rights.On Nov. 29, I showed up at her headquarters for a press event on victim services. But an inspector for her office who recognized me motioned me off to the side. A few minutes later, two Price staffers asked to talk to me. They told me I was not welcome.
They rejected my media credentials and questioned my legitimacy as a news
