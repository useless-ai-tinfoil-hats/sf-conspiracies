Most home listings in San Francisco have been on the market for over a month
-----
It often feels as if homes in the Bay Area get snapped up almost immediately after they go on the market.But the reality is a bit different. In May, 55% of homes for sale in the San Francisco-San Mateo county region were listed for a month or more without finding a buyer, according to a new report from real estate brokerage Redfin.
While that may appear high, it's down from 58% a year earlier, and is also lower than the national rate of 62%.
