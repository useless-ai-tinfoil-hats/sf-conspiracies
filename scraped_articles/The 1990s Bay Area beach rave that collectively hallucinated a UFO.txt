The 1990s Bay Area beach rave that collectively hallucinated a UFO
-----
Jenö Void had his head down when it — whatever IT was — happened.It was dark out, save for the moonlight and the soft glow from a Bay Area beach bonfire. He was DJing for a crowd of several hundred, but his eyes were on his turntables. He didn't see the commotion around him, the sea of dilated pupils looking out over the water as the alien melodies of early 1990s acid house filled the air.
He finished his set just as the full moon sunk over the horizon and the sun began to rise.
