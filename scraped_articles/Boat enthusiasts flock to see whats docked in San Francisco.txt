Boat enthusiasts flock to see whatâ€™s docked in San Francisco
-----
When the Stad Amsterdam, a 19th century style ship with 31 sails, arrived in San Francisco as a stop along its world tour, local sailing enthusiasts went out into the bay to greet it.Noah Limbach, a member of the Sausalito educational sailing nonprofit Call of the Sea, was one of those eager to see the clipper ship, with its three masts and 157-foot high sails.
"We got up early, left the dock around 6:30 a.m. and motored out, kind of at sunrise, and it was magical," he said.
