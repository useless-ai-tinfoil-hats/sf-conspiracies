Bay Area warmup begins with gusty winds today. Hereâ€™s what to expect
-----
An anticipated warming trend will begin across the Bay Area on Wednesday, but it will come with an extended period of strong winds.Scattered morning clouds will yield to afternoon sunshine, as a dry northerly breeze pushes clouds out of the region. Most of the day should be fairly calm throughout the Bay Area, but winds are expected to increase in the evening. Solano County will be hit by the powerful gusts first, gusting over 30 mph by 5 p.m. and eventually up to 50 mph overnight.
