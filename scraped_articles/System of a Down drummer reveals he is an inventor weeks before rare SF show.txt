System of a Down drummer reveals he is an inventor weeks before rare SF show
-----
In the world of nu-metal, System of a Down has been ruthlessly inventive. On tracks like "Chop Suey" and "B.Y.O.B." the Glendale band pushed the boundaries of an already experimental genre, blending vocalist Serj Tankian's signature growl with moments of delicate, soaring reprieve.Now, weeks before a rare performance in San Francisco, the band's drummer has taken that inventiveness to new, literal heights.
