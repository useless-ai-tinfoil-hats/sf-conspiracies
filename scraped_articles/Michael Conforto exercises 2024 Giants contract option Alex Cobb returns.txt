-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. â€” Outfielder Michael Conforto is not following pitcher Sean Manaea into free agency. The outfielder instead exercised his 2024 option and will remain with the San Francisco Giants for another year."I'm excited to be coming back," Conforto said. "Love this team and can't wait to get to work."
Manaea told the Chronicle on Sunday that he's opting out of his contract, but Conforto decided not to walk away from the remaining $18 million on his deal.
