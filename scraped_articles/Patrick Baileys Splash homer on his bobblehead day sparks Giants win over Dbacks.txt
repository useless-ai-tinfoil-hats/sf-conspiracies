Patrick Bailey’s Splash homer on his bobblehead day sparks Giants’ win over D-backs
-----
With an admirable sense of the moment, Patrick Bailey made the most of his bobblehead day.The second-year catcher pummeled a Splash homer into McCovey Cove — the first of his career — a two-out, two-run drive in the fifth that put the San Francisco Giants ahead for good in a 7-3 victory Saturday over Arizona. He might have completed a cycle, too, had not a ball he hit bounced off the warning track and into the stands, turning a possible triple into a ground-rule double in the seventh.
