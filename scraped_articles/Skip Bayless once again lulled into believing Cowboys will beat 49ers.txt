Skip Bayless once again lulled into believing Cowboys will beat 49ers
-----
Even if it felt weird for 49ers fans to root for the Cowboys on Sunday, Dallas made it worthwhile with a thorough win over the Eagles â€” one week after Cowboys fans enjoyed seeing the 49ers crush Philly. The payoff for both came in the Eagles falling to 10-3, tied with both the 49ers and Cowboys for the best record in the NFC.But thanks to their blowout wins over both Dallas and Philly this season, the Niners are back as the NFC's top seed and looked the part in Sunday's win over Seattle.
