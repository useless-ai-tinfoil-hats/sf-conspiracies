Hordes of pelicans take over Southern California beach near San Diego
-----
A massive swarm of pelicans has taken over a San Diego-area beach, barely leaving enough room on the sand for anything else.The pelicans have congregated at the Children's Pool in La Jolla. Local photographer Jim Grant "estimates there were over 1,000 birds" at the beach, KGTV reported.
"I have never seen that many pelicans sitting on the sand or on the beach," Grant told KGTV.
The Children's Pool is a sheltered cove north of San Diego, where harbor seals tend to congregate
