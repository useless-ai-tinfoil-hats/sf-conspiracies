Bay Area woman who put severed finger in Wendy's chili scrubbed from NYT story
-----
The New York Times has removed a quote from Anna Ayala — the San Jose woman who served four years in prison after planting a severed ring finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili in 2005 — from an article that was published Thursday.The article is about how Vice President Kamala Harris — the new presumptive Democratic nominee — is polling against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee she'll likely face in November's general election. It dedicated a whole paragraph to Ayala.
