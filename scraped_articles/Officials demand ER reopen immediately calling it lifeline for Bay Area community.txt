Officials demand ER reopen immediately, calling it ‘lifeline’ for Bay Area community
-----
The future of a recently closed emergency department in a coastal Bay Area community is up in the air, as local officials are demanding that it reopen immediately, against the wishes of hospital executives who shut it down temporarily for repairs.Seton Coastside in Moss Beach — about halfway between Pacifica and Half Moon Bay — includes an emergency department and a 116-bed skilled nursing facility. It closed April 1 to begin construction that's expected to take up to nine months.
