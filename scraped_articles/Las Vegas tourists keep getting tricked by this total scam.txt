Las Vegas tourists keep getting tricked by this 'total scam'
-----
The Plug looks like just another legal weed store: The front door is covered in big green pot leaves, a sign shows pipes filled with marijuana, and the shelves are filled with what appear to be marijuana products.But the store's terrible 1.2 star rating on Google Maps is a giveaway that this shop near the front doors of Planet Hollywood isn't quite what it seems. The Plug is one of a handful of hemp stores on the Vegas Strip that are apparently tricking tourists into buying cannabis
