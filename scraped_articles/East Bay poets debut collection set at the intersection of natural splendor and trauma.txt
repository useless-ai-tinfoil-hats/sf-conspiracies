East Bay poet’s debut collection set at the intersection of natural splendor and trauma
-----
"Eggtooth," Jesse Nathan's debut poetry collection, is alert to the wonderful and terrible things that happen beneath our feet.In a poem titled "In a Churchyard After Dark, with Ruth," friends "lounge in a burr oak's buttress-root couch." In "Between States," the "grass sea" of the 19th century Midwest is stolen from Indigenous Americans. In "Boy With Thorns," a locust tree's spike — "evolved to ward off long gone / mammoths" — pierces "my plantar fascia's rivers / of tissue."
