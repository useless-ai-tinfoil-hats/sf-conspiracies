One of S.F.â€™s biggest apartment buildings reportedly loses half its value
-----
NEMA, one of San Francisco's largest apartment buildings, has lost almost half its value in five years as it faces an "imminent default" risk on its mortgage, according to a new report.The 754-unit apartment tower was valued at $543.6 million in 2018 but is now valued at $279 million by real estate data firm Trepp. That's below the value of owner Crescent Heights' $384 million mortgage, an ominous sign indicative of the Mid-Market area's struggles.
