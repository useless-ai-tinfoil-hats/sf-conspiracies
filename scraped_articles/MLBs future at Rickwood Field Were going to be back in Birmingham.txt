MLB’s future at Rickwood Field? ‘We’re going to be back in Birmingham’
-----
Logan Webb didn't want to say goodbye to Rickwood Field."I think there should be a game every year," said the San Francisco Giants' right-hander, referring to the Birmingham facility that housed the Giants-Cardinals game June 20, Major League Baseball's tribute to the Negro Leagues. "There are a ton of great players that played at Rickwood. Obviously, I'd love to come to Rickwood every single year, but getting other franchises involved, too, would be awesome."
