The Ed McCaffrey commercial that made 49ers' Christian McCaffrey cry
-----
It's hard to imagine a McDonald's commercial making anyone cry, but that's exactly what left 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey in tears.The ad in question featured his dad, former Super Bowl champion Ed McCaffrey — then a member of the Denver Broncos — being stuffed into a locker (an exhaustive internet search couldn't turn up the commercial in question, but it was apparently very funny). Christian McCaffrey was 2.5 years old at the time and instead of laughing, he sobbed.
