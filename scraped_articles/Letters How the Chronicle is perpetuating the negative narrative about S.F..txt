Letters: How the Chronicle is perpetuating the negative narrative about S.F.
-----
It is no accident that readers are chastising the Chronicle for its chronic focus on negativity, and I urge the editors to remember their role in enabling and amplifying our city's national and international bad impression.Because the Chronicle is the main media voice of San Francisco, all the bad headlines are picked up and echoed by national and international media, creating a media "doom loop" that is not accurate or fair in describing actual conditions in the city.
Many good
