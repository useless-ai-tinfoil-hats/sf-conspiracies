The 49ers' longtime greatest strength is now their biggest problem
-----
Plenty of concerning things have come out of the 49ers' two-loss road trip to Cleveland and Minneapolis.Quarterback Brock Purdy has had two pedestrian games. Kicker Jake Moody has missed three of his past five field goal attempts, including a chance at a game-winner last week. The team's superstar-laden offense is incredibly banged up, with Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams missing Monday's game and potentially more.
But without question, the biggest concern for the 49ers right now
