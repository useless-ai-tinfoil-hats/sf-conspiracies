‘A last resort for me’: Valencia Street merchant launches hunger strike over bike lane
-----
Eiad Eltawil was rattling off the dozen or so businesses that closed on the Valencia Street corridor in recent months when he noticed a sheet of paper.There, next to a "FOR SALE" sign on a shuttered storefront near the corner of Valencia and 22nd Street, was a note to customers: "After 36 years of service, we have decided to close." Eltawil shook his head. Unless something changes soon, Yasmin — the casual Mediterranean restaurant he owns at 799 Valencia St. — could be next.
