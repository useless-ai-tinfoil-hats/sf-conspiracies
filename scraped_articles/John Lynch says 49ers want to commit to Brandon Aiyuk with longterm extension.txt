John Lynch says 49ers want to commit to Brandon Aiyuk with long-term extension
-----
This time John Lynch's answer had less ambiguity: The general manager made it clear that the San Francisco 49ers want to sign All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk to a contract extension this offseason."He's served us very well as a franchise, and I think we've got a nice track record of extending the players that are important to us," Lynch told reporters Tuesday at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. "Brandon is someone we want to keep around for a long time."
