‘F—k the locals’: Calif. restaurant owner apologizes for video criticizing San Luis Obispo
-----
A San Luis Obispo County restaurateur found himself in hot water after his social media team posted a TikTok where he cursed about local customers."F—k the locals," Roger Sharp said in a now-deleted TikTok video, with the profanity bleeped out. "That's the way I feel in my heart. I mean, because they're not going to be the ones that make us money, right? They're not who this place is designed for."
Sharp owns almost a dozen San Luis Obispo County restaurants, including Tortilla
