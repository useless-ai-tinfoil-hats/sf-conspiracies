Stroll inside a psychedelic alligator at this bizarre Calif. desert pop-up
-----
Tucked away in one of California's desert resort towns, the Living Desert Zoo and Gardens can activate your senses unlike any other wildlife refuge. For one month out of the year, the park begins to glow in the dark if you come at night.I've been to plenty of light festivals where lavender gardens sparkle and Christmas trees twinkle, but I was rendered a bit speechless by what I saw in Palm Desert, California. It was as if neon signs and Chinese lanterns had combined to have a baby.
