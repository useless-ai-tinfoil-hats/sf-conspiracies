Sonos' game-changing smart speakers are now 20% off at Amazon

I remember watching the original "Iron Man" for the first time in 2008 and being in awe at the ability of billionaire Tony Stark to talk to his house and get a response from his AI assistant Jarvis. While having AI running every facet of your home may still be a stretch, talking to a robot assistant is easy these days via Amazon Alexa â€” you just need a smart speaker with Alexa built in. Right now at Amazon, select Sonos smart speakers are on sale for 20% off, bringing the Era 100 down to $199
