Jim Sugar, adventurous Mill Valley-based photographer for National Geographic, dies at 78
-----
Once photographer Jim Sugar had a National Geographic cover story in his portfolio he was able to choose his own assignments, so he chose to drive a Volkswagen bus west from Washington, D.C., and then the length of the Pacific Coast, a project that took a full year of salaried time.Plus, the National Geographic book division paid for the van and supplied all the cameras and color film he needed, which turned out to be thousands of rolls because Sugar always shot everything.
