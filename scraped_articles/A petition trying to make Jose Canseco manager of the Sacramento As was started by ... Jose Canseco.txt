A petition trying to make Jose Canseco manager of the Sacramento A's was started by ... Jose Canseco
-----
A new petition dropped Monday on Change.org asking the soon-to-be Sacramento A's to appoint former slugger Jose Canseco, who once played for the Oakland-based team, as their manager.The catch to this one, though: None other than Canseco himself appears to have started it.
Canseco announced the petition Monday at 1:40 p.m. with a post on his X account. Listed on Change.org as being started by "Team Canseco," it calls on "the owners and decision-makers of the Athletics baseball team"
