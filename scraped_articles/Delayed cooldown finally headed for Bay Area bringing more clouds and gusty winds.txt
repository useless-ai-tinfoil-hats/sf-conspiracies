Delayed cooldown finally headed for Bay Area, bringing more clouds and gusty winds
-----
Thursday will start to feel a bit cooler across the Bay Area as an upper level ridge of high pressure finally starts to shift to the east. As that ridge starts to break down, the door opens up for a more robust marine layer to develop and bring with it more clouds, fog and gusty winds.The cooling trend was delayed by around 24 hours as Wednesday ended up with much less cloud cover and warmer temperatures than what was forecasted. Sunshine broke through across much of the Bay Area faster
