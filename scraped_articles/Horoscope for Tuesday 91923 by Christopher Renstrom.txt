Horoscope for Tuesday, 9/19/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): Rethink the ultimatum because it looks like you may be the one who has to yield the field. Leave some wiggle room so you can save face.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You won't achieve your aim, but it could still materialize in a different guise. Keep an open mind so that you recognize it when it appears.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Avoid making any big sales, purchases, or promises. What makes sense today could leave you scratching your head tomorrow.
