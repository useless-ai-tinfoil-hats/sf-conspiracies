Horoscope for Thursday, 03/07/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): There's a difference between negotiating aggressively and bullying. Tone it down because it looks like you're getting dangerously close to crossing the line.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Believe it or not that farfetched lead really could go somewhere. Sometimes you have to think outside the fenced-in pasture.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You'll have to help someone if you want to help yourself but only you can decide if this interdependent or co-dependent.
