How Chris Paul brought intensity, urgency to Warriors, helping young players break through

Being the bad guy has never been a problem for Chris Paul.He doesn't mind being cast as the villain, and he understands how that role can flip to hero when he comes to a new team.
I can't think of another Bay Area athlete in any sport who has done what Paul has done with the Golden State Warriors â€” come to the Bay Area as a villain and quickly win the hearts and appreciation of the home fans. Richard Sherman, maybe.
