Review: Jess Curtisâ€™ Gravity finds complex gifts in the absence of light
-----
For many audience members, the nearly pitch-black dance performance "Into the Dark" will be profoundly discomforting. It is also strangely and surprisingly life-affirming."We spent the past two days making it as dark as possible in there," choreographer Jess Curtis said in the lobby of CounterPulse before the San Francisco premiere of the show on Friday, Nov. 10. "Consent and care and safety are really key because we're doing some experiments we've never tried before."
