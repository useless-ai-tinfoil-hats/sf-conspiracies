Air quality advisory issued as smoke from Park Fire moves over Bay Area
-----
An air quality advisory was issued for the Bay Area Sunday and Monday as massive plumes of smoke from the Park Fire, burning north of Chico, drifted into the region overnight, appearing in satellite imagery and contributing to hazy skies.The smoke moved in as the winds aloft turned from a northerly direction, Roger Gass, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Bay Area office, told SFGATE Sunday. But smoke has been restricted to the upper atmosphere due to onshore flow.
