Acalanes shakes off early deficit and QBâ€™s injury to win first state title
-----
Sprinting full speed, Acalanes-Lafayette senior quarterback Sully Bailey saw the first-down marker Saturday but got nailed in the knee by a tackler just a yard short. Worse yet, he "felt something pop.""I knew it was bad," he said. "But I knew I had to finish the game. I had to go out and do this for everyone. It was bigger than me. We'd come too far."
If Bailey was going to sacrifice pain for the Dons, then senior teammate Paul Kuhner would sacrifice his knee brace for his partner
