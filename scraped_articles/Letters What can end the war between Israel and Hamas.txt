Letters: What can end the war between Israel and Hamas?
-----
No winnersIf Israel thinks it can find and destroy Hamas in those tunnels in Gaza, it is repeating the same mistakes the U.S. made in Vietnam.
The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese used similar tunnels to hide, recover, outmaneuver and attack American forces. Usually, U.S. troops could not find the tunnels, and when they did, it was hell fighting in them.
Now those tunnels are tourist attractions. I toured one outside Hanoi; it was deep, dark, long and scary. It survived B-52
