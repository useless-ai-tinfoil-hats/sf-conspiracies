49ers-Seahawks game will feature cannon that shoots bratwursts into the crowd
-----
The San Francisco 49ers' Thanksgiving night game against the NFC West rival Seattle Seahawks won't feature a T-shirt cannon, but it will feature something far better: The Bratzooka.The brainchild of Bavarian Meats, the Bratzooka is a compressed air bazooka that started firing foil-wrapped brats directly into the stands during Seattle's 2022 season. Well it's back this year along with a smaller, handheld "Mini-Zooka," both of which will be shooting sausages directly at Niners and Seahawks
