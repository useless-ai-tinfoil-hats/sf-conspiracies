49ers put Buccaneers away, but still need to shed frontrunner rep
-----
The San Francisco 49ers' motto for the 2023 season might be "get in your seats early." Because the outcome of the game might pretty much be determined before you get settled.On Sunday, the 49ers jumped out to a 7-0 lead on their second possession of the game. That was a good omen for how the day would go, because, coming into the game, when the 49ers had scored first they had already won six of seven games this season, mostly in dominant fashion.
Make that seven of eight victories
