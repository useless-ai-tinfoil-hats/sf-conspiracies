"It really is a hub for the community. I don't know a single Thai restaurant in Los Angeles that doesn't shop here, no matter how big or small they are."I'm standing smack-dab in the middle of the cavernous Thai wholesale market LAX-C with Vanda Asapahu. She's the second-generation chef running the savory side of the kitchen at her family's beloved 20-year-old restaurant Ayara Thai in the Westchester neighborhood, just east of LAX. (Her sister Cathy handles desserts.)
