Kyle Shanahan is a better 49ers coach than Jim Harbaugh ever was
-----
It has come in many forms over the past two weeks. The declaration, in some way or another, that "Kyle Shanahan's legacy is at stake in Super Bowl LVIII."I'm here to tell you that it really isn't. The 49ers' coach has already cemented his legacy among his NFL contemporaries and in 49ers team lore. Unless he goes full Greg Roman (how is that man back leading an NFL offense?) with his play-calling Sunday, Shanahan is already the second-best coach in 49ers history.
Yes, a Super Bowl
