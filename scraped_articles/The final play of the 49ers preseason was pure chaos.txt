The final play of the 49ers preseason was pure chaos
-----
If you were one of the sickos watching all the way to the final play of the preseason for the San Francisco 49ers in 2024, you may have been given quite the treat in one of the most chaotic preseason plays in franchise history.The 49ers and Las Vegas Raiders were tied at 24 with three seconds left, with the Niners lined up at their own 45-yard line. Mercifully, this was going to be the final play of the game regardless of the result, since the NFL ended preseason overtime a few years
