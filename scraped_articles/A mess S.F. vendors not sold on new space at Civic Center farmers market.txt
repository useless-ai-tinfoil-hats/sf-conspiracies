‘A mess’: S.F. vendors not sold on new space at Civic Center farmers’ market
-----
Tony Mellow did not know how wide a chasm 80 feet could be until his fruit stand was moved from one side of Hyde Street to the other Sunday, as the Heart of the City Farmers' Market was relocated after 42 years in San Francisco's United Nations Plaza."I figured the first day would be traumatic, and it is," said Mellow, who planned for that eventuality by bringing only half of his normal inventory of fruit to supply the stand run by Tony Mellow's Farm and Nursery of Morgan Hill.
