Yosemite desperately needs protection â€” from cars, not people
-----
Yosemite has led the National Park System from the beginning. Its core elements of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove of Big Trees were established as a public park in 1864, offering a model for the concept of national parks. Yosemite's John Muir then used his passion and eloquence to advance the national park idea. Decades ago, the park innovated once more by building a public transit system serving the east end of Yosemite Valley.Now it's time for Yosemite to lead again.
