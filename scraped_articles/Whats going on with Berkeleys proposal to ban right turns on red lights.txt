What's going on with Berkeley's proposal to ban right turns on red lights?
-----
Last year, Berkeley tentatively approved banning making right turns on red lights. But more than 12 months later, little progress has been made toward prohibiting the controversial maneuver.In November 2022, Berkeley Councilmembers Terry Taplin and Susan Wengraf proposed banning rights on red via a budget referral, requesting $135,000 to install "No Right on Red" signs at 135 intersections in Berkeley. Although the proposal was approved that month, it still hasn't made much progress.
