-----
LAS VEGAS — San Francisco 49ers tackle Trent Williams almost lowered his voice, fully aware he was about to commit football blasphemy.Then he cushioned his statement, praising Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce for being "as good as it gets." That didn't stop Williams from sharing a simultaneous truth about the Chiefs' defense.
"To me, the defense is kind of the reason they're here," he said. "Their defense has really kept them alive."
