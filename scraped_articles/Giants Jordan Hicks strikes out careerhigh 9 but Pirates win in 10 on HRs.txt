Giantsâ€™ Jordan Hicks strikes out career-high 9, but Pirates win in 10 on HRs
-----
As he racked up K after K Saturday evening, the only downside for Jordan Hicks was his climbing pitch count. His split-finger fastball dipping at the last second tantalized and mesmerized batters, finishing off eight of Hicks' career-high nine strikeouts.The San Francisco Giants, as is so often their wont, could do little with a gem of an outing from Hicks. Between their minimal offense and their occasionally erratic bullpen, they fell 4-3 to Pittsburgh in 10 innings at Oracle Park.
