ESPN's Kendrick Perkins thinks it's time for the Warriors and Klay Thompson to split up
-----
ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins believes it's time for Klay Thompson and the Warriors to break up.Thompson hasn't exactly had an ideal start for a player in a contract year, shooting below his career averages from inside and outside the 3-point arc. His last two games have been particularly rough: He went 0-for-1 before getting ejected from Tuesday's loss to the Timberwolves, and he followed that up shooting 1-for-10 from the field in Thursday's loss to the Thunder.
It's a far cry
