A's crushed 10-1 as Padres complete sweep behind Juan Soto's slugging feats
-----
Ignominious numbers have filled this lost season for the Oakland Athletics. On Sunday at the Coliseum, 18 became another number synonymous with the woebegone nature of the 2023 A's.San Diego completed a three-game sweep of Oakland with a 10-1 waltz. That marks the 18th time this season the A's have been swept, an Oakland record. The 1978 A's, who went 69-93, were swept 17 times. The 2023 A's are 46-103 with 13 games remaining.
The A's had not been swept in their previous seven
