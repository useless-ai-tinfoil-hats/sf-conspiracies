A year after announcing its closure, here's what it's like at Great America
-----
When I told friends I was going to Great America, everyone had the same reaction: "Great America! I haven't been there since I was 13!"Neither had I. It seems most Bay Area kids' memories of Great America are permanently locked in at adolescence. It was the first "cool" place where you were allowed to run wild, the first tummy ache from slurping frozen lemonades and getting rattled by a roller coaster, the worst headache you'd ever had when you were dehydrated in the blazing South Bay
