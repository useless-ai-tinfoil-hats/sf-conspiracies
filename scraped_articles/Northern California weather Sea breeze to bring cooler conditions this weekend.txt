Northern California weather: Sea breeze to bring cooler conditions this weekend
-----
The high-pressure system responsible for California's first heat wave of 2024 is on its way east, opening the door for cooler marine air to push into the Bay Area this weekend.This cooldown will be accompanied by gusty west winds in the afternoon and evening, blowing from the Pacific Ocean through the Golden Gate and along the delta toward Sacramento. This effect, known as the sea breeze, is a common summer phenomenon, but the strength of the winds can vary considerably.
