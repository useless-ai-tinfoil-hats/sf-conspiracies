Review: ‘Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’ ends its DC franchise run on a fun but typically flawed note
-----
The DC Extended Universe bids farewell fondly with "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom."In keeping with the general mishandling of Warner Bros.' attempt to compete with Disney's Marvel superhero movie machine, this sequel to the international top-grossing DC comics film drips with flaws. But it looks and moves great, with a more streamlined, propulsive story than 2018's "Aquaman" and more imaginative imagery drawn on returning director James Wan's horror roots ("Saw," "The Conjuring").
