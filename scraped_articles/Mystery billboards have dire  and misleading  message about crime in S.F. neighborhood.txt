Mystery billboards have dire — and misleading — message about crime in S.F. neighborhood
-----
On Tuesday morning, as residents of San Francisco's Richmond District embarked on their daily commutes and coffee runs, they were met with an arresting message."Since 2021 there have been over 20,000 robberies, burglaries and thefts in the Richmond," the new billboard screamed from Geary and Arguello boulevards.
About a mile and half away, at Geary and 25th Avenue, another: "In 2024 there have been almost 2,000 robberies, burglaries and thefts in the Richmond."
