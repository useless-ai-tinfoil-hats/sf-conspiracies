Gaza protesters used ‘sleeping dragon’ tactic to block traffic on Bay Area highways
-----
Protesters demanding an end to Israel's war in Gaza brought Bay Area traffic to a halt for hours Monday morning, using a human-chain tactic that's become increasingly popular in the past 10 years.Law enforcement has a name for it: the sleeping dragon. The term typically applies to instances of people locking their arms to carriage bolts inside PVC pipe, making it difficult for police to extricate them.
