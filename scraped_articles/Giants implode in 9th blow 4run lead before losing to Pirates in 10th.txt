Giants implode in 9th, blow 4-run lead before losing to Pirates in 10th
-----
PITTSBURGH â€” With a late jolt, the San Francisco Giants' little run of recent success jumped right off the tracks Tuesday at PNC Park.The Giants took an early two-run lead, thanks to an error by Pirates shortstop Oneil Cruz, got homers from Thairo Estrada and Matt Chapman and looked poised to win their fifth game in a row until one heck of a messy ninth inning, ultimately losing 7-6 in the 10th when Nick Gonzalez's first-pitch single off Erik Miller sent in placed runner Michael Taylor.
