LGBTQ activist Amber Hollibaugh, who aided defeat of Californiaâ€™s Briggs Initiative, dies at 77
-----
When the Briggs Initiative to prevent gays and lesbians from working in California public schools made the ballot in 1978, San Francisco activist Amber Hollibaugh could quickly see what was needed to defeat it.It needed someone with a working-class background who was brave enough to go out into the conservative strongholds of the Central Valley and explain that the Briggs Initiative was not just an attack on schoolteachers who happened to be gay, but also an attack on labor.
