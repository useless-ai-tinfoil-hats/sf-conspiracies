The SF Giants are somehow still alive in the race for Shohei Ohtani
-----
The San Francisco Giants are among the finalists in pursuit of signing Shohei Ohtani, one of the greatest free agents to hit the open market in baseball history.The latest report comes from USA Today's Bob Nightengale, who said that the Cubs were the latest team to drop out of the race for Ohtani, a player who can be the best pitcher and batter in the league in any given season, and the MVP from the batter's box. This leaves the Giants alongside the Dodgers, Blue Jays and even the Angels
