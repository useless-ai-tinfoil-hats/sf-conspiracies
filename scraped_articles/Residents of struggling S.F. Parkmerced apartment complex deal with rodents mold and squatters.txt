For six months, the man who lived upstairs in the garden-style apartment at 403 Gonzalez Drive terrorized his Parkmerced neighbors.Erick Rosemon banged on one resident's door and threatened to shoot his wife, according to interviews with tenants and police reports. Armed with a knife, he allegedly threatened two other residents and a letter carrier. When an ambulance showed up on an unrelated call, he allegedly vandalized the vehicle with his knife and stole an iPad from the front seat.
