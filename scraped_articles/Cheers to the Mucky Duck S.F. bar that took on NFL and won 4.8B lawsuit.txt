Cheers to the Mucky Duck, S.F. bar that took on NFL and won $4.8B lawsuit
-----
I was in luck.Friday, when I popped into the Mucky Duck sports bar in the Inner Sunset, shortly after it opened at noon, it was happy hour.
It was not, however, giddy hour, which one might have expected. No wild celebration, no flying Champagne corks, no raucous cries of "The NFL can kiss my hi-def!"
A lone customer sat at the long bar, talking to the bartender. The various TV screens around the bar were lit up, and music played on the jukebox, but the place was chill. Happy
