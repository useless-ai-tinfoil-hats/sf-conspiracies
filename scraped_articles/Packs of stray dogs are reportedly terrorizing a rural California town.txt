-----
A small unincorporated community in rural Southern California has been besieged by a pack of aggressive stray dogs this year, according to numerous reports.In March, roaming stray dogs reportedly killed over 300 sheep and goats in Anza, Riverside County.
"It was a massacre. It was a traumatic situation to come home to," Alex Avalos, a local farmer who says 30 of his goats were killed by dogs in one attack, told the Press-Enterprise. "My concern is: What if a kid is next."
