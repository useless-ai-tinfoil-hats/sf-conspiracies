‘I hate to see these things go’: BART’s fond farewell to its legacy train cars
-----
BART's slant-nosed legacy fleet of trains said their final farewell to the Bay Area on Saturday as thousands of people — from folks who rode the first train in 1972 to BART officials and self-described transit nerds from across the country — gathered in Oakland to celebrate the trains.Three of the trains made their final journeys, heading to Fremont before returning to the Hayward yard en route to a wrecking yard, where most of the original cars will be ground up and recycled.
