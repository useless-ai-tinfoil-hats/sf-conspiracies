Giantsâ€™ LaMonte Wade Jr. might be headed to IL after reinjuring left hamstring
-----
A hamstring injury will pump the brakes on LaMonte Wade Jr.'s torrid start to the season, leaving the San Francisco Giants without a core part of an offense that is just starting to find its identity.Wade exited Monday's 8-4 win against the Philadelphia Phillies with a strained left hamstring, the same injury that kept him out of the lineup twice over the weekend. He grabbed the back of his left knee while running into second base on a double off the right-field wall in the fifth inning.
