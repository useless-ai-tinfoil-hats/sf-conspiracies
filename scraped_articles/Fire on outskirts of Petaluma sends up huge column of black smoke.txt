Fire on outskirts of Petaluma sends up huge column of black smoke
-----
Firefighters rushed to quell a blaze that erupted Thursday afternoon outside Petaluma in the North Bay, choking the air with black smoke."It exploded," said James Doolittle, owner of a dog day care and boarding facility on Skillman Lane, about 500 yards from the eruption.
Gazing through his window, Doolittle watched thick smoky plumes blanket the horizon shortly before 2:30 p.m., he said in a phone interview. After about 20 minutes the clouds of smoke turned white and dissipated.
