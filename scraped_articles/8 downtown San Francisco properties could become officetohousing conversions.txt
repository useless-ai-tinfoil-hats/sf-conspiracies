Some of San Francisco's empty office buildings are one step closer to being converted into residential units.The owners of eight San Francisco office buildings responded to a request from the city for landlords interested in converting their properties into condos or apartments, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. (SFGATE and the Chronicle are both owned by Hearst but have different newsrooms.)
The properties would yield about 1,100 units if they were to all be converted,
