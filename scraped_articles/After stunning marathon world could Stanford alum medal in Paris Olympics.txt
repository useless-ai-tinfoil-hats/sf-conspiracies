After stunning marathon world, could Stanford alum medal in Paris Olympics?
-----
Last February, Liv and Malcolm O'Keeffe were watching the Olympic Marathon Trials from a balcony overlooking the course. The runners would come by and all the guests in the Puma Elite viewing spot would cheer, then run back inside to watch on television until the runners made another pass.The O'Keeffes' oldest daughter, Fiona, had taken the lead, but it wasn't quite sinking in. Here came Fiona again, out in front all alone. There she went. Here she came again, still in front.
