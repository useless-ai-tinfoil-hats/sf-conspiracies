Horoscope for Tuesday, 03/26/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Stop working so hard to make people happy. Mercury opposite the Moon in Libra is all about reverse psychology. Be more standoffish and they'll come to you.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): An associate will beat around the bush all day if you let them. Introduce a hypothetical situation and they'll divulge all - hypothetically, of course.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You're finally ready to act, but hold off a bit. An opponent is close to folding their cards.
