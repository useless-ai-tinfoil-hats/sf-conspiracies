California poised to allow ‘toilet to tap’ projects, in landmark water rule
-----
California water regulators are poised to approve long-awaited rules that will allow local water agencies to convert sewage — such as what drains from toilets and showers — directly into drinking water.The landmark regulations will go before the State Water Resources Control Board for consideration next week. If approved, they would enable projects sometimes dubbed "toilet to tap" to move forward in numerous communities, including Santa Clara County, Los Angeles and San Diego.
