In this Season of Sharing, help those facing homelessness and hunger
-----
Since 1986, the Season of Sharing Fund has raised $192 million to help care for and nourish 180,000 Bay Area households with critical needs. This includes families with dependent children, disabled individuals, veterans, victims of intimate partner violence and emancipated foster youth.Today, this support is more important than ever. Data shows nearly 1 in 5 Bay Area families has less than $400 in savings. When crises hit, no one should have to choose between medicine, rent or groceries.
