As an avid outdoor enthusiast myself, I love spending as much time as possible outside. Camping and hiking are two of my favorite ways to do it, and do you know the best way to combine these two activities? Backpacking! The trick with backpacking is that everything you'll need, you carry with you as you hike, meaning lightweight gear is essential, and nothing is more vital than a tent. Right now at REI, you can get a Northwood Series II 4-Person Backpacking Tent for just $112.73 while it's 60%
