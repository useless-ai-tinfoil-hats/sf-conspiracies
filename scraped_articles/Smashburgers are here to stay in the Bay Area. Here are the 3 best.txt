Smashburgers are here to stay in the Bay Area. Here are the 3 best
-----
The smashburger has proven its staying power in the Bay Area. You've seen them, I'm sure. They are burgers about the size of your palm, with beef that's pressed thin on hot plancha, forming lacy, caramelized edges that protrude out of buns like buzz saws. My theory as to why the trend has an extended lifetime lies in the dish's simplicity, a less-is-more ethos that makes it so attractive.The only problem, my dear reader, is that there are simply too many dang smashburgers.
