Letters: Having progressive politics in S.F. is one thing, actually getting things done is another
-----
Regarding: "Voters make it clear: San Francisco can no longer be called a progressive city" (San Francisco, SFChronicle.com, March 6): Many voters have progressive goals but reject the actual performance of our professed "progressives."The 2014 San Francisco Board of Education decision to not allow our students to have the option of taking algebra in eighth grade was done with the goal of equity, but it was a bad intervention and disadvantaged our children.
City voters are appalled
