Save $100 on the highly-rated Dyson V8 Origin+ cordless vacuum today
-----
Dyson is the gold standard of the vacuum industry, with devices so slick, I distinctly remember as a kid I wanted my parents to get the original Dyson Ball just because of how cool it looked on TV. Dyson vacuums are still among the best of the best, and one of the brand's top-rated cordless stick vacuums, the V8 Origin+, is 24% off today. Though it typically would set you back $400, with this limited-time deal from Walmart, you can get your hands on one for just $319.99.Dyson V8 Origin+
