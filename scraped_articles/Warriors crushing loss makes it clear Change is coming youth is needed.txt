Warriorsâ€™ crushing loss makes it clear: Change is coming, youth is needed
-----
The Golden State Warriors' cosmic reset began Tuesday night.The fates didn't even wait until the end of the game to deliver the message. The first indication came just seven minutes in against the Sacramento Kings, when Keon Ellis, an end-of-bench guard getting an emergency start because of injuries to teammates, stripped Stephen Curry in the open court, took the ball for a layup, was fouled and hit two free-throw tries for a 21-12 lead.
The game was young, but oh, the indignity.
