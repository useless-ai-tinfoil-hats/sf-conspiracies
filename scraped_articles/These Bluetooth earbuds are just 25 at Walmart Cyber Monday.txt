If you're the kind of person who loses things a lot, or you're just ballin' on a budget, a pair of $200 Apple Airpods might not make much sense. On the other hand, a pair of sub-$30 wireless earbuds might be very much what you're after.Right now you can pick up a pair of high-tech Veatool Bluetooth earbuds — which usually sell for $80 — for just $25 at Walmart for Cyber Monday. They come complete with a pocket-size charging case and some outstanding ratings from Walmart.com users.
