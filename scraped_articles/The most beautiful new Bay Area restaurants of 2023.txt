The most beautiful new Bay Area restaurants of 2023
-----
We go to restaurants for food, of course. But we also go for the design.Some restaurants are so beautiful, we feel an energetic lift as soon as we walk into them. We do a double take when we see a particularly dazzling chandelier. Or we smile at whimsical wallpaper that we'd never put in our house but so appreciate over the course of a two-hour meal.
Immersive dining rooms can captivate us. They can transport us. At the end of a long day, they can be the escape we crave.
