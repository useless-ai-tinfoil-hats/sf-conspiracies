McDonaldâ€™s plant-based burger flopped in S.F. trials, company reveals
-----
McDonald's test of its plant-based burger failed in San Francisco, according to Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald's USA."I don't think the U.S. consumer is coming to McDonald's or looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald's now," Erlinger said Wednesday at the Wall Street Journal's Global Food Forum. "It's a trend that we'll continue to monitor."
McDonald's rolled out the McPlant to stores in the San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth areas in early 2022.
