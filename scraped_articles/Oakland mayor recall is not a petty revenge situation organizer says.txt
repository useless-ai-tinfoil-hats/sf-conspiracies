Oakland mayor recall is not a ‘petty revenge situation,’ organizer says
-----
The organizers of a recall effort against Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao insist they're not looking for revenge.Last week, a group attempting to recall Thao announced that it had gathered enough signatures to begin working in earnest to place the issue before voters. It coincides with, but is not connected to, a separate recall effort against Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, and it comes a little more than a year after two successful recall movements in San Francisco.
