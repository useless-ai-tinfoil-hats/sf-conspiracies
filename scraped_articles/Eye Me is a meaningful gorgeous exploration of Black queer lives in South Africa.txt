‘Eye Me’ is a meaningful, gorgeous exploration of Black, queer lives in South Africa
-----
Before the analytical brain kicks in, the beauty and emotionality of Zanele Muholi's portraits strike the viewer. The South African artist, who uses they/them pronouns, presents their subjects with both a tenderness and, at times, austerity that reveal some essential part of their humanity.But while the works are enormously artful, there's very little artifice, even when props and styling are employed.
A self-described "visual activist," Muholi has long worked in photography.
