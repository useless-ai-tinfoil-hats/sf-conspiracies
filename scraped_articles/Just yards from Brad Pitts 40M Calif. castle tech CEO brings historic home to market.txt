Just yards from Brad Pitt's $40M Calif. castle, tech CEO brings historic home to market
-----
One of the first homes built in the Carmel Highlands — with more than a century of history, a tech titan owner and a movie star neighbor — has come to market, asking $7.95 million. The Spanish-style five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom abode at 151 Highlands Drive is known as "Stonewater." It was built just three years after Frank H. Powers and J. Frank Devendorf, who also developed Carmel-by-the-Sea and the Carmel Highlands Inn, established the neighborhood of Carmel Highlands in 1916.
