Is Nancy Pelosi’s decision to run for reelection selfish or selfless?
-----
When San Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced her plan to run for reelection to Congress, reaction was swift — and mostly divided into two camps.One side focused on a number: Pelosi is 83, and her decision to keep going added fuel to the argument that Congress is an overly geriatric institution. Her likely victory next year freezes the path for potential successors — including Pelosi's own daughter — who might bring a more youthful approach to the role.
