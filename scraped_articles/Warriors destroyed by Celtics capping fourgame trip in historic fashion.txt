BOSTON — The defensive game plan Sunday was implemented 15 minutes before the Golden State Warriors left the visiting locker room at TD Garden: concede Boston Celtics swingman Jaylen Brown the space to comfortably shoot from 3-point range and ignore him when on the weak side of floor.Said guard Stephen Curry: "Obviously, it didn't work."
Neither did anything else.
The Warriors (32-28) were overwhelmed — and outclassed in every facet of basketball — by their 2022 NBA Finals
