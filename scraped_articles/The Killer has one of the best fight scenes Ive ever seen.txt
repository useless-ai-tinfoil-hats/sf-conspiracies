'The Killer' has one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen
-----
If you grew up a '90s bro, as I did, you've been looking forward to David Fincher's "The Killer" ever since Netflix posted the trailer. "The Killer" makes a return to Fincher's cinematic roots, reuniting him with "Seven" screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and featuring an endless number of quotable, "Fight Club"-esque bro koans throughout the main character's narration. Also: lots of people die horribly in it. This is the kind of movie that I pretend I've grown out of, but very much have not.
