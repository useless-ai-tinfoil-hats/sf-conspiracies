-----
Backpackers will soon have to pay a modest fee to hike the popular Lost Coast Trail in rural Northern California — the first time that the federal agency managing the trail has imposed such a charge.The fee requirement, announced Wednesday, will take effect in six months. There's currently a flat $6 reservation fee to book an overnight trip on the trail via the federal booking website Recreation.gov. Beginning Nov. 8, there will also be a fee of $12 per hiker attached to the booking.
