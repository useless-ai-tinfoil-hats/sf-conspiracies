California Highway Patrol answers 6 'weird' questions about what's legal on state highways
-----
The California Highway Patrol has seen it all on state highways, including a Bay Area driver using a mannequin to allegedly cheat the carpool lane.To help inform the public about what is considered legal activity on the highway (or what could land you a ticket), CHP's office in Stockton started a Q&A series it calls "Weird Wednesday."
Throughout the summer and into fall, CHP posed a question every Wednesday morning and revealed the answer that afternoon through its Facebook page.
