This is the Bay Area’s ‘last affordable area.’ Here’s what home prices look like
-----
Florence Arkin knew she couldn't afford a house on the Peninsula where she'd grown up. And the market in much of the rest of the Bay Area in 2022 was too expensive for the single mother of two.That's when she started looking farther out in the East Bay, eventually finding a 2,200-square-foot house in Bay Point, part of unincorporated Contra Costa County about an hour journey from San Francisco by BART. It hadn't even hit the market yet, but Arkin knew she had to move fast.
