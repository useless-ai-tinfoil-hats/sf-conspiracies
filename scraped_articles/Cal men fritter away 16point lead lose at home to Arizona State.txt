Cal men fritter away 16-point lead, lose at home to Arizona State
-----
Leading by 16 early in the second half, Cal appeared on its way to an easy win over Arizona State at Haas Pavilion on Sunday.But the Bears committed 10 turnovers in that second half and the Sun Devils rallied to stun Cal 71-69. The Bears led for 35½ minutes — but not when it mattered most.
"To have a lead like that in the second half, this one hurts," Cal head coach Mark Madsen said.
ASU had a similar game Friday night at Maples Pavilion, when it trailed nearly the entire way
