S.F.â€™s best margarita bar has a secret menu
-----
There's no margarita like a Tommy's margarita. It's simple, barely sweet and designed to be a showcase for high-quality tequila. Because the recipe, created at Tommy's Mexican restaurant in San Francisco, eschews the sweet orange liqueurs that most margarita recipes call for, it really allows the flavor of the base spirit to shine through.The only question when you visit Tommy's: Which tequila? Sure, you can order a house margarita, which will come with Lunazul Reposado, but half the fun
