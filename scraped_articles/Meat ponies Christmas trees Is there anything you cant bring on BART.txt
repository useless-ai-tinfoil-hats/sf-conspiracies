Meat, ponies, Christmas trees: Is there anything you can't bring on BART?
-----
People in the Bay Area are known for pushing boundaries. That even applies to how they take public transit, including what accompanies them onto BART trains, apparently.A Reddit post showing a group of people carrying a Christmas tree along San Francisco's Embarcadero on the way to BART recently garnered attention for begging the question: "Can you bring a Christmas tree on BART?"
The answer, evidently, is yes, though you may want to consider the tree's size when purchasing.
