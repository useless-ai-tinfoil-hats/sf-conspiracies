Oakland plans to close gaping budget deficit without layoffs or public safety reduction
-----
Trying to steer the city onto surer financial footing, Oakland officials say they have found a way to close a steep budget deficit without laying off any staff or reducing public safety functions such as police and firefighting, critical adjustments as the city works to find its way out of a post-pandemic malaise.The deficits, $117 million this year and $175 million the next, will be closed partly through tough personnel moves, such as an nearly complete and indefinite freeze on hiring.
