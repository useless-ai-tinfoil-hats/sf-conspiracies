Sure, trading Steph Curry is crazy. What if Warriors took it a step further?
-----
You know it's a flimsy argument when you don't believe in it yourself. I blame Sporting Green colleague Scott Ostler for the confusion, because he proposed a radical idea this week — the Golden State Warriors trading Stephen Curry — and here we take it a step further.What if the Warriors moved on from the Big Three altogether?
Again, this not only carries a NO WAY sign in flashing red neon, the notion is almost too shocking to take seriously.
Almost.
Ostler's proposal
