A few feet from the NWSL expansion draft war-room table inside the executive offices of PayPal Park, a Bay FC banner hung behind a podium where Jordan, a 10-year-old girl, read on the broadcast the pick off a card handed to her by director of football operations Andrew Loomis.The team's second pick of the draft was in: the North Carolina Courage's Tess Boade.
After, the Bay FC front-office executives, headed by general manager Lucy Rushton, cheered at their merch-scattered table.
