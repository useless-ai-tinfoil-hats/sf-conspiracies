Can this winery bring a Michelin star to Sonoma?
-----
Sonoma has zero Michelin-star restaurants. But a local winery could change that.Stone Edge Farm Vineyards & Winery, a premium producer of classically styled Bordeaux wines, will open Enclos in downtown Sonoma this spring. Owners Mac and Leslie McQuown have tapped San Francisco chef Brian Limoges, who previously cooked at Michelin-starred spots like Atelier Crenn, Quince, Saison and Birdsong, to run the kitchen.
Enclos (139 E Napa St.) will offer an 8- to 10-course tasting menu
