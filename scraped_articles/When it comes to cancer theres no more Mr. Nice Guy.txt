When it comes to cancer, thereâ€™s no more Mr. Nice Guy
-----
There's a lot of waiting around with cancer. For example, I had a massive amount of radiation in February to zap that monster tumor in my left lung, but it won't be until May 16 that I learn whether it did any good. And while I wander in this limbo, there's a lot to get done: bone scans, CTs, immunotherapy.And before each of these events, there is the waiting room.
This is just my experience, but in the past year, I've noted that there aren't a lot of talkers in an oncology ward.
