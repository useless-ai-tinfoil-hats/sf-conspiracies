Tulip Day blooms in S.F. as thousands wait hours for pick of free flowers
-----
After about a three-hour wait in lines zigzagging around Union Square, Socko Cisneros and Xen Garcia finally were able to get free tulips as part of an annual giveaway hosted by the Union Square Alliance.The partners each picked out eight flowers from what was left of the 80,000 given away Saturday afternoon during Tulip Day.
"It was a little overstimulating because there were a lot of people," Cisneros said. "But we picked each other flowers, so it was a nice little experience."
