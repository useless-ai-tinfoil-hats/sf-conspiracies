The ‘visionary’ behind S.F.’s Presidio is retiring. But the park will keep evolving
-----
When Michael Boland joined the Presidio Trust in 2001, the historic parade ground was a potholed parking lot. Dead fish dotted Mountain Lake at summer's end. Inspiration Point's view toward the Palace of Fine Arts and the bay was shuttered by pine trees.Today, a 7-acre lawn has replaced the parking lot at the heart of the old Main Post. Mountain Lake shimmers year-round. Inspiration Point has wide open views and a rugged grandeur, as do four other outlooks added within the one-time Army
