Get a $100 Blink outdoor security camera for just $60 at Amazon
-----
Back in the day, adding a security system to your home was an undertaking, to say the least. You had to run a ton of wires, hang up heavy cameras, set up video recorders to store the footage and more â€” and the video quality was never even that good to begin with. These days, wireless HD security cameras have made home security a breeze. You probably think of Blink primarily for its doorbell cameras, but the brand also offers some of the most popular wireless security cameras on the market.
