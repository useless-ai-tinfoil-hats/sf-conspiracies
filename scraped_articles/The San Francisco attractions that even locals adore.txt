The San Francisco attractions that even locals adore
-----
It's no surprise that San Francisco draws more than 20 million visitors each year, especially with its stellar bucket list of things to do. In fact, even born-and-bred locals continue to love the city for its many attractions.We still photograph the Golden Gate Bridge like it's our first-born child. We love our famous fog so much it has its own social media presence. We'll even bravely venture into SF's tourist center near Fisherman's Wharf just to get an Irish coffee or live Dungeness
