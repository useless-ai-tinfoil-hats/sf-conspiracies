You can't do it alone, so don't even try.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You are one half of a partnership even if you feel ignored. That said, there are many ways to get someone's attention - like not budging until you do.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Careful about the information you decide to share with friends today. They're not as ready as they say they are to deal with the truth.
