Keeping San Francisco ‘fun’: City to cut red tape and fees for live music
-----
It's about to get cheaper and easier for San Francisco venues to enliven their parklets and back patios with live jams.On Tuesday the Board of Supervisors will take a final vote on a package of entertainment permit reforms that will waive the application fee — which can range from $562 to $792 — for restaurants or bars seeking to offer entertainment of amplified sound in outdoor parklets or patios. The board unanimously passed the legislation on its first reading.
