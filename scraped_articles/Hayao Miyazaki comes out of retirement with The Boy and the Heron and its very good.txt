Hayao Miyazaki comes out of retirement with 'The Boy and the Heron,' and it's very good
-----
In many ways, Hayao Miyazaki's new film, "The Boy and the Heron," resembles his 2001 masterpiece, "Spirited Away": A displaced and homesick child takes a journey through a magical portal to a dangerous, dreamlike land to save their family."The Boy and the Heron" bears allusions to Studio Ghibli's vast 37-year body of work, but it's notable that Miyazaki has once again returned from retirement to create this film. "The Boy and the Heron" doesn't simply rehash what we expect from Miyazaki
