The bullying and death of an Oklahoma nonbinary student just showed us who really isnâ€™t safe in school
-----
Last week, a family buried their nonbinary child, Nex Benedict, who died after being brutally beaten in the girls' bathroom at their high school in Oklahoma. According to their mother, 16-year-old Benedict had been bullied relentlessly for a year leading up to the incident, in which a group of peers ganged up on them and a trans student. It's a horrific case and one that is inseparable from its context amid a climate of seemingly unceasing anti-LGBT demonization in the state and the nation.
