The one thing the 49ers and their fans can look forward to this offseason
-----
It's pretty hard to ask any 49ers fan to find any type of cheerfulness on the Monday after Super Bowl LVIII.Not after another crushing defeat in the Super Bowl, one that extends the franchise's championship drought to 29 full seasons without a title. Not after their third loss in the Super Bowl in the last dozen years. Not after their seventh trip to the NFL's final four in the last 13 years, and fourth in the last five, only to once again miss out on the ever-elusive Lombardi Trophy.
