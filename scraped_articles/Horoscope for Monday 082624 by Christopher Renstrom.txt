ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You don't like to say others are right. It isn't pride. It's mistrust of the status quo however it's OK to say it because this time they are.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You're so fixated on figures that you're losing the forest for the trees. Move on to something else. When you return, you'll find a clearing.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Don't believe everything you hear - especially when it's meant to throw you off the scent. Follow your nose for facts.
