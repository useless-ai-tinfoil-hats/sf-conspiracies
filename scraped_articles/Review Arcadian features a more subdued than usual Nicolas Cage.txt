Review: ‘Arcadian’ features a more subdued than usual Nicolas Cage
-----
"Competent enough" may not sound like high praise, but it means more than usual when applied to the current state of horror movies or most things Nicolas Cage has been in for the last 15 years. So good for "Arcadian," a simple but perfectly serviceable dystopian thriller that's a little too mysterious for its own good yet still serves up tight suspense and cool, icky monsters once it finally gets going.And the performances? Adequate as they can be.
Cage is Paul, a very concerned
