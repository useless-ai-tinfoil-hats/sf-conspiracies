-----
Golden Gate Park is testing a new feature for visitors in the recently revamped area around Middle Lake.The previously neglected lake is open to the public after a $10 million restoration project, complete with new signs to increase accessibility.
Daniel Montes, a spokesperson for San Francisco Recreation and Parks, told SFGATE that by scanning a QR code on the signs, visitors can listen to an audio tour that includes history and background information on the surrounding ecology.
