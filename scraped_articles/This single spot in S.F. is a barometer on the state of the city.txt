This single spot in S.F. is a barometer on the state of the city
-----
United Nations Plaza, a 2Â½-acre park where Market, Seventh, Hyde and McAllister streets come together, is a kind of civic barometer that measures the state of life in San Francisco. When it's good, and the sun is shining, it shows all the promise of the city. When it is bad, U.N. Plaza is a mess: drugs, hopelessness, the mark of a failed city.Right now, it's both. By day, the area is surprisingly vibrant, with kids and games and sunshine. By night, the old demons emerge from the shadows.
