Horoscope for Wednesday, 10/18/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): You're sending "keep away" signals. It's why people maintain a respectful distance. If you truly want company then ease up.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You're right to be angry with a colleague who failed to back you up, but this person's still in your life for better or for worse. Consider it water under the bridge.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Histrionics are to be expected when the Moon is in Sagittarius. Thankfully people's tantrums are more sound
