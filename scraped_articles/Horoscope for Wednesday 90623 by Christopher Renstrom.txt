Horoscope for Wednesday, 9/06/23 by Christopher Renstrom

ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): A difference of opinion is turning into something else. Disengage and get some distance before a gap becomes a chasm.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): It's galling that you have to tap into a rainy day fund, yet the occasion - although not an emergency - demands it. Don't worry. You'll replenish resources soon.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): You know that you're right, but don't press it. Let tempers cool and friends will see the error of their ways.
