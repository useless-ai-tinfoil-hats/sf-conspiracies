Stephen Curry’s ankle injury adds to pain of Warriors’ loss to Bulls
-----
Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry didn't have a hand in deciding the game Thursday at Chase Center against the Chicago Bulls.He had his right foot in a bucket of ice.
"His spirits are high," said teammate Draymond Green after a 125-122 loss that Curry couldn't finish. "So hopefully, it's not too bad. But we've just got to wait and see."
Curry rolled his right ankle in the fourth quarter after corralling a pass as he cut to the basket, promptly hobbling off the court
