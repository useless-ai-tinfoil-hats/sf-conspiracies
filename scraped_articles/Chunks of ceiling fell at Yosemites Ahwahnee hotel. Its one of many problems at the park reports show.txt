Chunks of ceiling fell at Yosemite’s Ahwahnee hotel. It’s one of many problems at the park, reports show
-----
In April of last year, as winter began to fade at Yosemite, several diners enjoying views of the melting mountain snow while at the famous Ahwahnee hotel were suddenly shaken from their bliss. Chunks of the high ceiling above came crashing down.The debris landed on tables in the hotel's grand Solarium, toppling wine glasses and scouring white linens, and, according to one employee who was there, prompted screams from spooked dinner guests. Some raced for the doors.
