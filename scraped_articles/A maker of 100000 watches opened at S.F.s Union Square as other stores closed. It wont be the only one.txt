A maker of $100,000 watches opened at S.F.’s Union Square as other stores closed. It won’t be the only one
-----
Despite downtown San Francisco's sea of empty storefronts, one of the world's top luxury watch brands has opened a new boutique, just east of beleaguered Union Square. It won't be alone, with three other upscale watch stores planned nearby.German watchmaker A. Lange & Söhne isn't your typical retailer. Its store, which it calls a salon, occupies a third-floor space at 140 Geary St., rather than the ground floor. Most customers book an appointment beforehand, rather than wandering in.
