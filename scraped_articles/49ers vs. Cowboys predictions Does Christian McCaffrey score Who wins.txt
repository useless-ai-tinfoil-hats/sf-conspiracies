-----
The San Francisco 49ers play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. In the NFL, few matchups are more characterized by as much decades-long history and enmity. The two teams have played 39 regular-season games, with the series split 19-19-1. They've also had nine playoff showdowns, with the Cowboys holding a 5-4 edge. The prime-time matchup between the two teams at Levi's Stadium is anything but typical regular-season football.We asked 49ers beat reporter Eric Branch and columnists Ann Killion
