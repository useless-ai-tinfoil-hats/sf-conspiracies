Review: West Edge Opera’s ‘Bulrusher’ gives operatic form to Mendocino’s rivers and redwoods
-----
Bulrusher has made it to age 18, as a young woman of color in 1955, without having heard of Jim Crow. When she learns of another Black woman getting thrown out of an Alabama department store for using the front door, she wonders why.That's partly a function of her isolation as the only Black kid in Boonville (Mendocino County). But it's also a result of the beguiling, thoughtful way Berkeley native Eisa Davis — a playwright and now a co-librettist — builds dramatic worlds.
