He passed the California bar at 17. At 18, heâ€™s now prosecuting criminal cases
-----
Peter Park doesn't find it that unusual that at 17, he recently became the youngest person to pass the California bar exam.Or that he started law school online when he was 13 years old, as he was beginning high school. Or that he was sworn in as a prosecutor for the Tulare County District Attorney's Office last week, shortly after turning 18.
