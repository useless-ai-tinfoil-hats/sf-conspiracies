49ers lost a draft pick because they overpaid a player $75,000 and he didn't give it back
-----
Apparently, the reason the NFL penalized the San Francisco 49ers for what the team called a "clerical payroll error" was because the 49ers gave one of their players too much money.The NFL announced last week that the 49ers would have to drop their 2024 fourth-round pick four spots, to the back of the round at No. 135, and forfeit a 2025 fifth-round pick after a league review found errors at the end of the 2022 season.
General manager John Lynch was asked about the situation Monday
