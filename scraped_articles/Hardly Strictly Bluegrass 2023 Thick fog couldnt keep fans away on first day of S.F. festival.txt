Hardly Strictly Bluegrass 2023: Thick fog couldnâ€™t keep fans away on first day of S.F. festival
-----
Festivalgoers braved wet grass, muddy trails and San Francisco's signature fog to attend the first day of the 23rd annual Hardly Strictly Bluegrass in Golden Gate Park.By the time performers hit the stage at 1 p.m. Friday, Sept. 29, the mist that blanketed the park was thick enough to make it difficult to see from one side of Hellman Hollow to the other. Warm hats and puffer jackets were abundant as crowds gathered at each stage.
