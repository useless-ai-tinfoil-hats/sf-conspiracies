-----
Back in the day, a meal at Sam Wo was served with a side of verbal abuse.The century-old San Francisco Chinatown institution was known for having "the world's rudest waiter." Edsel Ford Fung, who customers "came to see and be verbally abused by," was infamous for "flirting with girls, rudely criticizing customers and reminding people about tipping him," chef and writer Shirley Fong-Torres wrote in her 2008 book, "The Woman Who Ate Chinatown: A San Francisco Odyssey," per the LA Times.
