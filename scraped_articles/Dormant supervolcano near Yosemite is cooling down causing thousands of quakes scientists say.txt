Dormant supervolcano near Yosemite is cooling down, causing thousands of quakes, scientists say
-----
Just east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, scientists have been keeping an eye on a long-dormant supervolcano which has caused thousands of earthquakes in recent years.Two theories could explain the unrest: either the volcano was at risk of an eruption, or it was cooling down. Now, a group of researchers says new acoustic images prove it's the latter.
The Long Valley Caldera, located just under 200 miles east of the Bay Area, was formed by a supereruption about 760,000 years
