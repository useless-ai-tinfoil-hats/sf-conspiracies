Why is this building abandoned in the heart of S.F.? Its history includes an engineering miracle and an epic planning blunder
-----
The building at 200 Franklin St. is the kind of San Francisco mystery that becomes more confounding the longer you've lived here.Situated on prime Hayes Valley real estate, the building is a grand but seemingly abandoned three-story brick structure, surrounded by fencing but still cared for. And it has appeared this way for decades, sitting vacant while the city around it grows and changes.
The most random part: No one can be seen going in or out, but a decade ago posters of jazz
