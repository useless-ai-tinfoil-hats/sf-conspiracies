A Bay Area sandwich sensation is expanding
-----
Delirama, an East Bay deli sensation known for its standout pastrami, sandwiches and bagels, is opening a second location.Delirama Jr. will open next year at 5512 San Pablo Ave. in Oakland. It's a much smaller space than the original on Solano Avenue in Berkeley, so owners Cash Caris and Anahita Cann are planning for a no-frills sandwich shop. There will be pastrami sandwiches and subs served throughout the day, plus coffee, hand-rolled bagels and breakfast sandwiches in the morning.
