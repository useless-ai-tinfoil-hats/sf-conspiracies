This block is the epicenter of the battle over blocked driveways in S.F.
-----
If you're looking for parking in the Marina and are thinking about squeezing into a risky spot between driveways on the 1500 block of Chestnut Street, you might want to keep looking â€” there's a good chance someone is going to call the city, and you might just get a ticket.From June 2018 to April 2024, Marina residents filed more than 720 complaints about blocked driveways on that block, and 440 citations for the violation were issued.
It's not the only block with driveway problems.
