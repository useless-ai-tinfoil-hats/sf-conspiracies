This "luxurious" four-person tent is 40% off just in time for summer
-----
Summer's upon us, and I plan to spend it how it's meant to be spent: camping outside, swimming in creeks, bathing in bug spray, and clinking canteens and Old No. 7 around a campfire.My next camping trip's coming up in July – our annual family campout in Calaveras Big Trees State Park (shifted away from Lake Tahoe as it grapples with overtourism) – and with that in mind, I find myself eyeing the slick-looking, storage-packed Bridger 4 tent by Mountain Hardwear.
