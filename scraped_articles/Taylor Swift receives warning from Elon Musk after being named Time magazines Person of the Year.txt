Taylor Swift receives warning from Elon Musk after being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year
-----
After a blockbuster year on her Eras Tour, Taylor Swift was named Time magazine's Person of the Year earlier this week — and tech tycoon Elon Musk had something to say about it."Some risk of popularity decline after this award. I speak from experience lol," the X CEO and owner tweeted on Thursday, Dec. 7, as a response to the pop star's post thanking the publication for the recognition.
