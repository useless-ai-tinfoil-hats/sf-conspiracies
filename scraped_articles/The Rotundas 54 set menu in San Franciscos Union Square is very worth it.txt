The Rotunda's $54 set menu in San Francisco's Union Square is very worth it
-----
On a crisp December afternoon in Union Square, I rode four flights of escalators up to the restaurant at the top of Neiman Marcus. Inhaling the heavy scent of mall perfume and tinny din of holiday tunes, I tried to catch glimpses of the department store's towering Christmas tree light fixture on the way up. Two life-size nutcrackers stood at the restaurant's entrance, indicating I'd arrived.It was time for one of San Francisco's bougier holiday traditions: afternoon tea at the Rotunda.
