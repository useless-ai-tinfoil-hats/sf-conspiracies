Manningcast delights in 49ers running back's viral jersey-swap denial
-----
The 49ers were far from their best during Monday's 22-17 loss against the Vikings, but star running back Christian McCaffrey looked like he carried the bad vibes into the postgame.Broadcast cameras caught McCaffrey speaking with Minnesota defensive tackle Harrison Phillips as both sides shook hands on the field. While it wasn't clear what was said between the two, Phillips began to take off his jersey, and, in response, McCaffrey gave the player a tap on the back and a small head shake.
