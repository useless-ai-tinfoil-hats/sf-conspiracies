Queen Anne Victorian Exudes Charm
-----
Understated Elegance in Eureka Valley(ad) For Kevin Ho and Jonathan McNarry of San Francisco's Vanguard Properties, the Queen Anne Victorian at 234 Eureka Street isn't just another listing. This stately home, which they first encountered as a "fixer," holds a special place in their careers and personal history. "We saw this as a fixer in 2012," Ho recalls. "And it most certainly showed its 1904 heritage back then. This is a home that keeps popping up for us and it gets better each time."
