Fans incensed at Seahawks' Pete Carroll flinging gum into crowd during 49ers rout
-----
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll's obsessive gum chewing during games is well documented. According to The Sporting News, Carroll — a classic Bubble Yum chewer — chomps through "roughly 15 pieces of gum per game and around 260 pieces of gum per season." ESPN's Adam Schefter once did an entire segment on a German Seahawks superfan who has a piece of gum chewed by Carroll in a memorabilia case.But where those 15 pieces of gum per game end up has been covered far less.
