‘Unruly Navigations’ challenges expectations about diaspora, embraces beauty in complexity
-----
It might seem a tad on the nose for an institution named Museum of the African Diaspora, but one of its latest exhibitions, "Unruly Navigations," quickly upends easy assumptions about diaspora.Refreshingly, the show surprises in its willingness to let the diasporic experience express its multiple messy, painful and beautiful complexities without insisting on a single interpretation or issuing a judgment on unfolding histories.
