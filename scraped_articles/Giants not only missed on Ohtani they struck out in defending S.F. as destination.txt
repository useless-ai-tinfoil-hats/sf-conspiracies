Giants not only missed on Ohtani, they struck out in defending S.F. as destination
-----
Got caught in the San Francisco doom loop Thursday night.I was downtown near Civic Center and witnessed a violent scene. A young girl was being attacked by a gang. Help finally arrived. A cannon was fired. The melee ended in the stabbing death of the gang leader.
Rough town, man. Fortunately, my family was safe, watching the horror unfold inside the War Memorial Opera House, the famous mice-versus-soldiers scene in the San Francisco Ballet's "Nutcracker."
No wonder Shohei
