Pac-12 honors for Cal’s Uluave and Ott, Stanford’s Karty repeats
-----
Cal linebacker Cade Uluave didn't become a starter until late October after Jackson Sirmon's season ended because of a biceps injury. Uluave took advantage of his opportunity so well that he was named the Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year on Tuesday.Though Uluave started only five games, he led Pac-12 freshmen in tackles with 58 and tackles for loss with 6.5. He had two fumble recoveries, one of which he returned 51 yards for a touchdown in the Bears' 42-39 win over Washington
