S.F. system for housing homeless is broken, service providers say
-----
For four months last year, Jessica Hassen-Whitson, 45, was a prisoner in her home, a permanent supportive housing unit in a hotel on Turk Street in San Francisco assigned by the city's homelessness department. The elevator and doorways were too narrow for her plus-size wheelchair and she couldn't get over the unit's front steps. Her partner, Jason Davis, 33, had broken his leg and could no longer carry her.During that time, she left the apartment only twice, for doctor's appointments.
