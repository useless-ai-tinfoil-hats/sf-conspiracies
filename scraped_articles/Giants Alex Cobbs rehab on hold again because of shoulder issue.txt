Giants’ Alex Cobb’s rehab on hold again because of shoulder issue
-----
Two days days after his latest bullpen session, San Francisco Giants pitcher Alex Cobb developed what they called "mild shoulder inflammation" in his right arm and was to get examined by team orthopedist Ken Akizuki on Thursday night.Cobb, an All-Star last season, had been progressing so well in his rehab from offseason hip surgery that a return to the rotation in May seemed likely. But he had a recent setback when experiencing a mild flexor strain in his elbow and was briefly shut down.
