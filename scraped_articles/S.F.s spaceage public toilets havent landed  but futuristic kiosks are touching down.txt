S.F.’s space-age public toilets haven’t landed — but futuristic kiosks are touching down

One year after the prototype landed, San Francisco's space-age toilets have yet to descend en masse. But there's a new futuristic form beginning to appear downtown — 16-foot-tall advertising kiosks that look a bit like dappled metal cigars.The kiosks have a function beyond displaying come-ons for consumer goods of various sorts: They will generate the revenue that makes the free public toilets possible.
Six are now installed, displaying public art rather than the vertical video
