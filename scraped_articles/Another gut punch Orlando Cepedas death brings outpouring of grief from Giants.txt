‘Another gut punch’: Orlando Cepeda’s death brings outpouring of grief from Giants
-----
Along broadcast row in the Oracle Park press box Friday night, the San Francisco Giants' announcers were tipped off to the horrible news — Orlando Cepeda had died at 86 — and were informed the announcement would be coming at 8:30 p.m.In the Spanish broadcast booth, Tito Fuentes was on the air at the time, so Giants PR man Matt Chisholm notified his partner, Erwin Higueros. Higueros waited until the end of the half inning, pulled Fuentes to the back of the booth and gave him the news.
