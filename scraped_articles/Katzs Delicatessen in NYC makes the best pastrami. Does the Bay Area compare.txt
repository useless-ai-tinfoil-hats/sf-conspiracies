Katzâ€™s Delicatessen in NYC makes the best pastrami. Does the Bay Area compare?
-----
I'll never forget the first time I went to Katz's Delicatessen. I was living in New York City for graduate school, and a particular class was centered around visiting different historic or venerable eateries throughout the five boroughs to give us a taste of the many cultures and diasporic histories of New York City. The city's oldest, still-operating deli remains one of its best and the standard to which all pastrami sandwiches should be held. Established in 1888 in Manhattan's Lower East
