'Aggressive shark behavior' temporarily shuts down California beach
-----
LATEST, Nov. 6, 2:40 p.m. A pygmy sperm whale that washed up off Huntington Beach with a shark bite was euthanized at the scene, the Pacific Marine Mammal Center told SFGATE on Monday afternoon."It became clear he was very unstable and [showed] symptoms of cardiac arrest," said Dr. Alissa Deming, vice president of conservation, medicine and science at the center. "He was not a great candidate for rehabilitation. The best and most humane thing we could do was euthanize it."
