ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Be ready to lower your asking price to make the sale work. It may not be the killing you expected, but it's still money in your pocket.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): People change, which means you should revisit the set-up of a partnership. Believe it or not you aren't as retiring as you used to be.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Your suspicions that a project or sale was on shaky ground are confirmed when you see that someone else is backing out too. Thank
