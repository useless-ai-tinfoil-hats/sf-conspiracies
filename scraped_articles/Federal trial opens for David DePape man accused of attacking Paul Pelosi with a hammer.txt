-----
Opening arguments began Thursday in the federal trial of David DePape, the man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi in his San Francisco home just over a year ago.According to prosecutors, DePape, who was apparently drawn into a web of right-wing conspiracy theories, sought to confront Rep. Nancy Pelosi when he broke into the Pelosi's Pacific Heights home in the small hours of Oct. 28, 2023.
He allegedly only found Paul Pelosi at the residence, and struck him in the head with a hammer
