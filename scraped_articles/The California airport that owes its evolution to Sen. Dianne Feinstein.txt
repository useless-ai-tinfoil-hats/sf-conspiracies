The California airport that owes its ‘evolution’ to Sen. Dianne Feinstein
-----
Sen. Dianne Feinstein has died at age 90 with years of influence behind her, and among her many legislative feats, the San Francisco-based politician notched a lesser-known achievement: championing airports across California.Earlier this year, Feinstein and Sen. Alex Padilla earmarked $139.5 million in federal funding for upgrades at eight airports across California, including San Francisco International Airport, which received $31,000,000 for extensive updates to a terminal roof.
