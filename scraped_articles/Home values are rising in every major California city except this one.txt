When Daniel Winkler organized an open house for a home in Albany on a recent Sunday, more than 80 people came to see the property, the East Bay broker said.That same day, his company held four open houses in Oakland. They got a total of just 11 visitors. One of the homes didn't get any.
*  More real estate: Most Californians own a home by 49 years old. These maps compare that to other states
