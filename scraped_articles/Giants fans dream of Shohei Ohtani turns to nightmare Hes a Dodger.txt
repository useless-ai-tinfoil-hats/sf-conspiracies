Giants fans’ dream of Shohei Ohtani turns to nightmare: He’s a Dodger
-----
Shohei Ohtani in Dodger blue. Outfitted in the famous jersey with the iconic underlined "Dodgers" script across the chest. Above the red number 17. With big block letters on the back: "OHTANI."Swinging for the fences in a stacked lineup with Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, as one of the game's premier hitters. Eventually taking the mound in dominant fashion, as one of the game's premier pitchers.
