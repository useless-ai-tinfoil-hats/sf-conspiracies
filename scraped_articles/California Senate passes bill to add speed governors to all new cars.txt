California Senate passes bill to add 'speed governors' to all new cars
-----
If some California legislators have their way, your car could soon scold you if you exceed the speed limit.On Tuesday, the state Senate passed SB 961, a bill sponsored by Sen. Scott Wiener. The bill requires passive speed governors to be added to all new cars manufactured or sold in California by 2032. Speed governors would alert drivers with "audible and visual signals when they exceed the speed limit by greater than 10 miles per hour," a press release from Wiener's office said.
