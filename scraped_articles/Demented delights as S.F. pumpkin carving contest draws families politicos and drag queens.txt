Demented delights as S.F. pumpkin carving contest draws families, politicos and drag queens
-----
Theo Rodden, 10, wasn't planning for the pulp inside of his pumpkin to bleed out of the scowl he carved — but it might have been what won him the contest."I tried to make it kind of classic, with the triangle eyes, but more … demented," he said, pointing to the sharp eyebrows he carved on his jack-o'-lantern. But leaving the dangling pulp, he conceded, was his mom's idea. "That was the part that made it."
Their teamwork paid off: Theo went home with the "scariest pumpkin" award
