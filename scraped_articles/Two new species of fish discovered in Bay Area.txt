Two new species of fish discovered in Bay Area
-----
Not much research has focused on the lamprey — a fish with a toothy mouth shaped like a suction cup that can be more than 2 feet long — but UC Davis doctoral candidate Grace Auringer loves an underdog.She wound up discovering something surprising: two new species of lamprey, one in the Napa River and the other in Alameda Creek.
"We very soon realized we had some really exciting findings," Auringer said.
