No snow? No problem at the Calif. restaurant where it's winter year-round
-----
Skiers across most of California may be bemoaning the lack of fresh powder this season â€” but there's a 66-year-old snow-covered restaurant in one small suburb where it's winter every single day, no matter the outside temperature.It's a literal log cabin where you can eat lunch or dinner next to one of two stuffed grizzly bears, there are always peanut shells on the floor and there's inexpensive beer on tap.
