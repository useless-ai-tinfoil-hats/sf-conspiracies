Amazing wildlife on display on a rare trip to the Farallon Islands off S.F. coast
-----
The first thing you notice after stepping foot on Southeast Farallon Island is that the animals are in charge. And they are loud.Western gulls hurl piercing shrieks from their nests along the island's main path. Sea lions grunt from the rocky shore in such numbers that the sound reverberates from another island more than half a mile away. Hundreds of thousands of common murres trill a kazoo-like sound.
