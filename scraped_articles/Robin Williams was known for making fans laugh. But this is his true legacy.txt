Robin Williams was known for making fans laugh. But this is his true legacy
-----
Robin Williams died 10 years ago this month, and for many it remains the most traumatic celebrity death of recent memory. People loved him, not only for his work, but for him, either because they knew him or because of the real person that came through in his work.Like Buster Keaton, Jean Harlow and Tom Hanks — though not many others — he was a Hollywood celebrity that it seems nobody ever had anything bad to say about.
I met him once for a period of an hour or so at a Comedy Day
