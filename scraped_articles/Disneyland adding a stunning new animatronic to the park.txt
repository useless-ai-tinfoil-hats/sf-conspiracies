Disneyland adding a stunning new animatronic to the park
-----
It's hard to overstate Walt Disney's presence in Disneyland, even almost 60 years after his death. But for the first time, the man himself will be featured in a park attraction. At the D23 fan convention in Anaheim, the company announced that Walt Disney is getting his own animatronic, which will be featured in an all-new show."The reason that we're together tonight is because of one man's dream," Disney Parks head Josh D'Amaro said during the Disney Experiences presentation on Saturday.
