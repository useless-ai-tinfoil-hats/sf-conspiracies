A stalled 40-story condo tower in S.F. could be revived with a plan for more density
-----
An effort to rezone more than a dozen parcels in a stretch of San Francisco known as the Hub district for more height and density fizzled out in 2020, initially due to community opposition, and ultimately because of the pandemic.However, one project in the area — which spans about 84 acres and is centered at Market Street and Van Ness Avenue near the Civic Center — that was declared dead last year after it was seized by its lender is seeking a restart, by way of a density boost.
