'Really unusual': 3 river otters found dead on Bay Area road
-----
Christian Anthony was driving into San Francisco along Point Reyes-Petaluma Road near the Nicasio Reservoir last Saturday when he came across a disturbing sight: three dead river otters lying on the asphalt."It was really unusual," said Anthony, who is from Inverness and runs the popular West Marin Feed Instagram account and newsletter.
He has encountered dead wildlife before, but never so many animals at once. "I have never seen anything like that," Anthony said.
It's a sad
