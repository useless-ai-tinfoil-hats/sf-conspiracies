De La Salleâ€™s dominance resurfaces in Northern California 1-AA blowout
-----
De La Salle-Concord football coach Justin Alumbaugh welcomed Clovis North's perfect record and physicality Friday. He even enjoyed that the school brought its band, fog machine and 30-foot inflatable Bronco."I just wanted to see how tough we were," Alumbaugh said. "I wanted to put our kids in a grinder. They've got a big line and big backs. They came at us. And we came at them."
The Spartans (11-2), not the national juggernaut they once were, are still formidable as they showed in
