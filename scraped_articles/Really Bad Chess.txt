Really Bad Chess
-----
Maybe you were one of the many people who began playing chess because you watched The Queen's Gambit during the pandemic. Or maybe you attempted to play chess and realized: oh yeah, chess is actually pretty hard. Whatever your skill level, Really Bad Chess is a modern take on the classic game, where pieces are randomized and not mirrored. With a different board every day, and an Undo button if you get stuck, everyone can channel their inner Anya Taylor-Joy.
