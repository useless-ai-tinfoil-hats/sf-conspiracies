Pop-ups have arrived in S.F.â€™s Financial District. Do things feel any different?
-----
If nothing else, San Francisco's young Vacant to Vibrant program, with its 17 budding businesses showcased in nine Financial District storefronts, shows that "vibrant" is in the eyes of the beholder.Some pop-ups pop open only a few days each week, meaning that most of the time they are tantalizing voids. The ones that keep more extensive hours are at the mercy of passers-by on still-quiet sidewalks.
That's the impression two weeks after the city-led program kicked off with fanfare.
