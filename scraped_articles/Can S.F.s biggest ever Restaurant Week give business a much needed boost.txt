Can S.F.â€™s biggest ever Restaurant Week give business a much needed boost?
-----
In 16 years at her Tenderloin restaurant Brenda's French Soul Food, chef Brenda Buenviaje has not once participated in San Francisco Restaurant Week. But after a slow 2023, this year Buenviaje is finally trying out the promotional program, serving a $30 special for shrimp and grits, a drink and a beignet."Everybody thought we'd be out of that (downturn) in 2022, but we still haven't been profitable in three years," Buenviaje said.
Brenda's is in good company. Fall 2023 S.F.
