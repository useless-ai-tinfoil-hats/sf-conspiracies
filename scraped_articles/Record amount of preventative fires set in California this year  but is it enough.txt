Record amount of preventative fires set in California this year — but is it enough?
-----
California has seen a record amount of prescribed burning on federal lands over the past year, helping reduce wildfire risk and perhaps tempering this year's young but already worrisome fire season — though many say more should be done.The U.S. Forest Service announced this week that burn crews had intentionally set fire to 63,878 acres in California since the start of the federal budget year on Oct. 1. The effort surpasses the previous annual high of 63,711 acres burned in 2018.
