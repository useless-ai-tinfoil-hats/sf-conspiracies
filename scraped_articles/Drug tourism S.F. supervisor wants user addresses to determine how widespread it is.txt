Drug tourism? S.F. supervisor wants user addresses to determine how widespread it is
-----
Supervisor Matt Dorsey wants the city to track the home addresses of people who have been arrested for using drugs in San Francisco or who have died from drug overdoses, as well as people on city welfare, in an effort to get hard data on the widely-held perception that the city's drug users are engaging in "drug tourism."In a letter sent to the city controller Wednesday, Dorsey requested a formal analysis that will standardize a research methodology and report on known address histories
