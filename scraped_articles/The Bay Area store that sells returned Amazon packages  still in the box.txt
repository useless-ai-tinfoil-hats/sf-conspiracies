The Bay Area store that sells returned Amazon packages — still in the box
-----
When you walk into Marini's Discounts in Concord, you're greeted by several walls lined with dented, scuffed Amazon packages. The shipping labels — perhaps once addressed to you — are ripped off. A printout of an Amazon product page is taped to the front, indicating what lies inside.There's no shaking the feeling that you're making off with stolen goods. But the bin store is perfectly legit — and the concept is gaining popularity all over the country.
