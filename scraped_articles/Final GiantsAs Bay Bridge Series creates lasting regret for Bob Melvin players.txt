Final Giants-Aâ€™s Bay Bridge Series creates lasting regret for Bob Melvin, players
-----
Bob Melvin wanted to delay any thoughts about his final visit to the Oakland Coliseum for as long as possible, but a message from his sister forced him to confront reality.The message was a photo dating to 1979 of Melvin, a high school senior at the time, suited up for a workout with the Baltimore Orioles on the Coliseum field. He'd been drafted out of Menlo-Atherton High School, but went to Cal instead of signing with Baltimore. For the Bay Area native, this photo was worth keeping.
