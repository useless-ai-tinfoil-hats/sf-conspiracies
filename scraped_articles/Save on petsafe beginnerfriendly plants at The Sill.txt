Save on pet-safe, beginner-friendly plants at The Sill
-----
I've always been afraid of having plants in my home. That's a weird admission, I know, but it's not for the reasons you might think. Some people fear their plants will die (we don't all have green thumbs). That's not it for me. Others might be cautious because their pet could eat the plants. Again, this is not my issue. For me, it comes down to sheer laziness and not wanting to purchase the plants at a store. Insane, I know. I've walked into plant stores multiple times and had heated debates
