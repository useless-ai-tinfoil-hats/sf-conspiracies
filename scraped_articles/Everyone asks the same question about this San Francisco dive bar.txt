Everyone asks the same question about this San Francisco dive bar
-----
Hobson's Choice was the first bar I was ever a regular at in San Francisco. It was the summer of 2002, and I was sharing a room at Haight and Central with my buddy Mani. We both slept on air mattresses and lived out of duffel bags. The room didn't even have a door; it just had a sarong that dangled between the door frame. We were young and broke, and it was glorious.Mani worked at a smoothie shop further up Haight Street and became friendly with a girl named Liz, and then so did I. Liz
