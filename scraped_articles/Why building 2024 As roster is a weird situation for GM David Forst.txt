Why building 2024 A’s roster is ‘a weird situation’ for GM David Forst
-----
NASHVILLE — Imagine the Oakland Athletics' sales pitch to potential free-agent targets."We're interested in you. We like you. We think you could help us. We'd like to offer two years. But we have no idea where you'll suit up in 2025. … Does that work for you?"
Unless a free agent is coming off a major injury or a rotten season, it seems far-fetched he would want to join the A's on a multiyear deal. The A's remain in limbo as to where they'll play after their Coliseum lease expires
