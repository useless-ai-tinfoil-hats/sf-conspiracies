See's Candies to permanently close downtown SF shop on Christmas Eve
-----
While chocolate is a big hit in the East Bay right now, Bay Area-headquartered See's Candies is permanently closing one of its San Francisco locations. Located at 3 Embarcadero Center, which is near where a number of small business pop-ups recently opened with three months of free rent, the 102-year-old company posted on the door of the shop that the last day of business at that location will be Dec. 24.Since 1921, See's has been synonymous with holiday cheer and Christmas gifting games.
