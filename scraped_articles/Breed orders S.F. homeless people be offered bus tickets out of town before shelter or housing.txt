-----
Mayor London Breed has ordered city employees to offer homeless people a bus ticket out of town before presenting shelter or housing as an option.The mayor's new executive order, which marks a shift from current practices, comes amid an escalated crackdown on homeless encampments after a recent Supreme Court ruling gave city officials more power to enforce anti-camping laws. San Francisco officials are ramping up citations and arrests against homeless people who refuse to move indoors.
