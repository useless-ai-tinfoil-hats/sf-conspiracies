Review: ‘The Instigators’ stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck in a lively, entertaining caper comedy
-----
Some movies are just pleasant to hang out with. They're not intended to be great or to make an important statement. They're intended to be fun and reliable. "The Instigators" provides that kind of experience.Matt Damon, Casey Affleck and director Doug Liman ("Swingers," "Go") have all done major work. Here they do assured, off-the-cuff work, with lots of skill behind their seeming casualness. And throughout, they seem to be enjoying each other as much as we're enjoying them.
