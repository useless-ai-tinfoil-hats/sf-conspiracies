De La Salle boys fall to Modesto Christian in NorCal Open quarterfinal
-----
De La Salle boys basketball coach Marcus Schroeder easily could have pointed to the long-limbed, uber-productive 6-foot-6 elephant in the gym, but chose not to do so.Instead, he praised the Modesto Christian Crusaders on their 51-49 Northern California Open Division opening win over the host Spartans, whose key junior, Alec Blair, sat out the fourth quarter with an injured knee.
Gavin Sykes scored 18 of his game-high 20 points in the second half, including a flip shot in the lane
