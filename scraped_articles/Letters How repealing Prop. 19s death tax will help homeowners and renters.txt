Letters: How repealing Prop. 19’s ‘death tax’ will help homeowners and renters
-----
I hope that the California voters who own homes, and even those who do not, find the value of getting the Repeal the Death Tax proposition onto the 2024 ballot.The children of California homeowners face being taxed right out of their homes, if not the state. Half of Proposition 19, passed in 2020, was a blessing for older folks who wanted to move and carry their property tax rate with them anywhere in California, but not so for others, like my family and millions of others.
