USF men in solid spot as WCC play begins Thursday, but thereâ€™s a catch
-----
Not only does USF own the WCC's best record at 11-4 heading into conference play Thursday night, but more important, Chris Gerlufsen's team had the conference's best NET ranking as of Wednesday at 39.That might prove problematic for the Dons if they're looking to grab an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament come March.
Because with St. Mary's (52) and particularly Gonzaga (57) sporting lower than normal NET numbers and with no other WCC team having a NET better than Santa Clara's
