Stretch of major Peninsula highway closed on weekend of 49ers game
-----
Drivers headed south through the Peninsula this weekend may want to steer clear of Highway 101 through Redwood City, as Caltrans closed a nearly 1-mile stretch of all southbound lanes from Friday night through Monday morning for construction.The closure will impact travel to Sunday's San Francisco 49ers game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.
A similar closure of the northbound lanes will take place two weekends later, Oct. 13-16, as workers replace the Cordilleras Creek Bridge.
