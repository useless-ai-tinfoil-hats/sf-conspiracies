‘It’s killing us’: Damage to Pacifica pier is crushing local businesses
-----
After Pacifica's pier shut down due to storm damage, local businesses said they were relying on each other and the local community to weather what, for some, has been a dramatic downturn in business.The historic location has been shut down since Dec. 28, after high tides and massive waves damaged the far end of the pier, as well as its guardrails and supports. Ever since, local merchants say the lack of tourists coming to fish or walk down the pier has caused a drop-off in foot traffic
