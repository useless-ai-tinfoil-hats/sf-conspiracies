-----
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — It has been four years since new San Francisco Giants lefty Blake Snell walked around Tropicana Field, but the hallways are so familiar that Snell couldn't help but notice everything that has changed.The first thing he noticed: a makeshift barbershop set up near the home clubhouse.
"Saw a lot of new additions," Snell said. "The barber, that wasn't here before. … Just cool to see how many years have gone and what's new."
