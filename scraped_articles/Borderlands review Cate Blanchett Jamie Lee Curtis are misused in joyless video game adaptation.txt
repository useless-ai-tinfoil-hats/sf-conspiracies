'Borderlands' review: Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis are misused in joyless video game adaptation
-----
It's taken a long time, but shows based on video games finally passed the bar of quality entertainment, even artistry, with the likes of "Fallout" and "The Last of Us."Now we have a "Borderlands" movie, and it's back down to level one.
Perhaps adapting the popular video game for the big screen instead of television was the first mistake. After all, it takes place on the "ugliest planet," Pandora, and it's just not a pleasant environment to get immersed into for an hour-and-a-half.
