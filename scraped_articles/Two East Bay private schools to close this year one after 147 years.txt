-----
Two longtime East Bay Catholic schools are closing their doors because of financial difficulties, administrators said.Both St. Anthony Catholic School, a nearly 150-year-old school in East Oakland, and Our Lady of Guadalupe, which has operated in Fremont since 1964, are slated to shut down at the end of this academic year in spring. St. Anthony might reopen in fall 2025 with a new program.
St. Anthony Catholic School informed the campus community in a Feb. 7 emailed statement
