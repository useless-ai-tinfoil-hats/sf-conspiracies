BroadwaySFâ€™s 2024-25 season is full of fan favorites and new hits. Here are the titles
-----
When BroadwaySF flings wide the lobby doors for its 2024-25 season, it'll be with a musical that premiered in San Francisco in 2003 and later enjoyed a 20-month, 660-performance run here.That's the gravity-defying "Wicked," Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz's prequel to "The Wizard of Oz," which, running Aug. 28 through Oct. 13 at the Orpheum Theatre, opens the presenter's next lineup.
The rest of the schedule, announced Tuesday, Feb. 13, combines fan favorites with new hits.
