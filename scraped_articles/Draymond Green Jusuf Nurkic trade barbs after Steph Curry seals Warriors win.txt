Draymond Green, Jusuf Nurkic trade barbs after Steph Curry seals Warriorsâ€™ win
-----
The sellout crowd inside Chase Center roared. Stephen Curry crouched and flexed. Joe Lacob pumped his fists and cheered.Draymond Green smiled in satisfaction.
"I knew his goal was to get me out of the game," Green said in reference to Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic. "No one wants to see in me in the game. That makes the game a lot tougher.
"But it'd take a pretty good 'ish' talker to get me to do that. That's just too obvious. It's OK. It was a fun game."
For Green
