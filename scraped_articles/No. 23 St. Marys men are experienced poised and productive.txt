No. 23 St. Mary’s men are experienced, poised and productive
-----
Including four redshirts, St. Mary's returns 12 players from a team that went 27-8, tied with Gonzaga for first place in the WCC (14-2) and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year.No wonder Randy Bennett feels confident in his Gaels, who are ranked 23rd in the nation, as he enters his 23rd season as the head coach in Moraga.
In a phone interview, Bennett said his team has "a lot of leadership back and — in my opinion — a lot of good players."
