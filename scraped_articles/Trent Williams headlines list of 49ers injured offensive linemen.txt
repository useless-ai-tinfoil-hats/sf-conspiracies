Trent Williams headlines list of 49ers' injured offensive linemen
-----
Trent Williams declined a group interview request in the locker room Monday night, but the San Francisco 49ers' All-Pro left tackle wasn't completely mum."I'm good," Williams said to several reporters. "I know you want to ask me about the injury. I'll be all right."
The 49ers very much hope Williams' optimistic outlook is accurate.
Williams, a 10-time Pro Bowl selection, did not return after he exited in the third quarter of the 49ers' 33-19 loss to the Ravens on Monday night
