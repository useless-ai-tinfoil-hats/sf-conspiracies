How to turn off emergency test alerts on your phone
-----
The U.S. federal government is scheduled to test its emergency alert system Wednesday and send test messages to mobile phones, radios and televisions across the country at approximately 11:20 a.m. PT. Cellphones will vibrate and make a noise.The Federal Emergency Management Agency is running the test to ensure the process is working effectively and to help the public become familiar with it.
But some people may find the alert to be a nuisance, or have sleeping little ones at home.
