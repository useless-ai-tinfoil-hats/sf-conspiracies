Letters: With COVID surging, here is advice that will help during the holidays

Regarding "Rise in COVID, flu and RSV prompts Bay Area health recommendations â€” including masking" (Health, SFChronicle.com, Dec. 1): I was pleased to see the story about the surge of COVID and respiratory illnesses. I was, however, disappointed that there was no mention of the advice that was circulating during the worst of COVID: testing before gathering.Wearing a mask is important, but when families are gathering for the holidays, they are eating, making masking quite impossible.
