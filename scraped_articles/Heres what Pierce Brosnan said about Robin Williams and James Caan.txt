Hereâ€™s what Pierce Brosnan said about Robin Williams and James Caan
-----
Right before he was cast as James Bond and well after he was done as TV's Remington Steele, Pierce Brosnan spent one of the warmest summers he ever spent in San Francisco, playing straight man to Robin Williams.Warm as in feelings, that is.
During an appearance at the Smith Rafael Film Center in San Rafael on Saturday, Dec. 16, Brosnan called Williams "inspirational" during the filming of the blockbuster 1993 comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire," among the most beloved San Francisco-shot films.
