S.F. supervisor calls to ban turns on red lights throughout the city
-----
Right turns on red lights could be a thing of the past in San Francisco if one city supervisor gets his wish.Supervisor Dean Preston introduced a resolution Tuesday calling on the Municipal Transportation Agency to ban the vehicular maneuver at all stoplight intersections in San Francisco. Such a move would put the city on par with New York, where right turns on red are already banned at most intersections as part of its push to curb severe and fatal crashes.
