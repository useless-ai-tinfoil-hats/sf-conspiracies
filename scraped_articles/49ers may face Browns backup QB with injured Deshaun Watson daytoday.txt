-----
The NFL's third-ranked defense could face a second-string quarterback.The San Francisco 49ers may not go up against Browns QB Deshaun Watson when they visit Cleveland on Sunday. Watson, who has a bruised rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder, didn't practice Wednesday after he missed the Browns' 28-3 loss to the Ravens on Oct. 1. Cleveland had a bye last week.
Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Watson was still unable to throw with enough velocity due to the injury he suffered Sept.
