Clarence Thomas quotes former SF mayor in striking down gun control law
-----
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas cited the late California Sen. and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein in a Friday decision that overturned a federal ban on bump stocks. The court's conservative supermajority ruled 6-3 to overturn a Trump-era ban from 2019 on a firearm attachment that essentially turns a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic one.Thomas, writing the opinion for the majority, said that bump stocks don't turn a weapon into a "machine gun" as defined under U.S.
