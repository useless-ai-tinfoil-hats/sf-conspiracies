Giants place Blake Snell on the 15-day IL on day he was due to start
-----
Blake Snell, the San Francisco Giants' top offseason addition, got off to a rough start to his season after signing late and getting in no spring training starts. On Wednesday morning, the team placed the left-hander on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to Tuesday.Snell has an adductor strain, which, according to manager Bob Melvin, cropped up during Snell's most recent bullpen session. It's a moderate strain, which means Snell could miss more than the 15-day minimum.
