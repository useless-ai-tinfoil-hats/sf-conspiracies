Aâ€™s trading Mason Miller? The thought is so ridiculous, and typical
-----
The most dominant pitcher in Major League Baseball works at 7000 Coliseum Way without much fanfare only because there's not much of a fan base. Imagine if Mason Miller were on another team entering in the ninth inning to a stupendous light show and loud music as a huge crowd stands, cheers and anticipates victory.It would be quite the spectacle, and fans across baseball's landscape are fantasizing about the Oakland Athletics' one-of-a-kind closer joining their teams this summer.
