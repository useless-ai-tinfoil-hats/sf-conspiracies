Large areas of California are without maternity care as hospitals close labor wards
-----
El Centro Regional Medical Center delivered the last baby at its 67-year-old maternity ward in early January. Then it closed its obstetrics department, leaving just one other hospital to deliver the approximately 2,500 babies born every year in Imperial County.A month later and 625 miles north, Sonoma County residents lambasted the health system Providence for its decision to cease labor and delivery services at Petaluma Valley Hospital despite promises to keep it open through 2025.
