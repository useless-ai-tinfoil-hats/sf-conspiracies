Review: ‘Best. Christmas. Ever!’ is the stale fruitcake of holiday comedies
-----
The movie calls itself "Best. Christmas. Ever!" so you can be forgiven for expecting more.You'd think there'd be funny jokes. Maybe a little "Moesha" nostalgia with Brandy Norwood co-starring. Or with Heather Graham of "Boogie Nights" and Jason Biggs of "American Pie" as the other leads, perhaps some holiday naughtiness.
Alas, "Jim and Rollergirl Do Christmas" would be as inaccurate a title for this stale fruitcake of a comedy as the one it's already got.
