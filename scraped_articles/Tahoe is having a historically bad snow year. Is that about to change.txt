Tahoe is having a historically bad snow year. Is that about to change?
-----
Lake Tahoe snow totals have been so low that some anxious locals on Reddit have joked about making offerings to snow gods in hopes of fresh powder.But those prayers may soon be answered, at least to an extent.
Two snowstorms are expected to hit Lake Tahoe this week, a welcome sight to the area that has been starved for snow so far this season. The Tahoe area has received less than a third of the snow that would be expected by this point of the winter.
