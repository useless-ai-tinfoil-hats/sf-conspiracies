S.F. robotaxi company Cruise looking to shed more office space in the city
-----
Robotaxi company Cruise is working to reduce its office footprint in San Francisco.Late last week, the SoMa-headquartered company listed its roughly 110,000-square foot office at 345 Brannan St. available for subleasing, according to a brochure for the space. Real estate services firm CBRE has the listing.
The brochure shows that Cruise is looking to exit its office, which spans the entire five-story building, seven years early â€” the lease for the space expires in November 2031.
