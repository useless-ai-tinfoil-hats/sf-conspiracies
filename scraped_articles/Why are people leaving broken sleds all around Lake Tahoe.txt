Why are people leaving broken sleds all around Lake Tahoe?
-----
Beyond the pull of Tahoe's ski resorts, the region's "snow play" areas and sledding hills attract tens of thousands of people this time of year. But visitors are leaving behind more than tracks in the snow. They're abandoning large numbers of broken plastic sleds.These aren't classic wooden toboggans or metal saucers. They are distinctly flimsy candy-colored polyethylene that sell for between $5-15 at grocery stores and outdoorsy shops around the basin â€“ convenient and affordable enough
