Andrej Stojakovic transfers to Cal from Stanford, giving Bears former 5-star recruit
-----
Mark Madsen's efforts to rebuild the Cal roster got a boost Saturday just as Kyle Smith's efforts to rebuild the Stanford roster took a hit. That's because swingman Andrej Stojakovic, who spent his freshman season with the Cardinal, announced on social media that he is joining the Bears.Listed at 6-foot-7, 190 pounds, Stojakovic is the son of former NBA forward Peja Stojakovic. Andrej averaged 7.8 points per game last season when he played in 32 games, including 10 starts.
