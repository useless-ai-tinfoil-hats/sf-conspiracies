It's mid-June, and nearly every Major League Baseball team is a contender, and if that remains the case in late July, the trade deadline could be one big dud.Blame the fact that 40% of the 30 teams reach the playoffs, which makes most teams justifiably believe they've got a chance for October baseball. Also blame the fact an abundance of teams are hanging around .500, including the San Francisco Giants, which means there's either a lot of parity or a lot of mediocrity.
