-----
The swaying suspension bridge that leads visitors to the historic Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands is closing indefinitely for repairs, park officials said Monday.Sightseers will still be able to wander down the half-mile trail leading up to the Gold Rush-era landmark and attend paid sunset tours, but "anyone hoping to go inside the lighthouse may be a little disappointed for the time being," Julian Espinoza, spokesperson for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, said
