A family feud is tearing apart Americaâ€™s oldest tiki bar
-----
One of San Francisco's oldest and most recognizable bars, Trad'r Sam, temporarily closed this weekend as a stormy legal dispute among the family members who own it splashed into public view.But fears gathering on social media that the Richmond District tiki bar has closed permanently are unfounded, said John Munguia, who owns the business in a 50-50 partnership with his sister Dorothy Riedel. Trad'r Sam will reopen in "a few weeks" at 6150 Geary Blvd., where it has operated for 86 years.
