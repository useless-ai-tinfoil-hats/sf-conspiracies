Queer Arts Featured, a bright light in the struggling Castro, enters new chapter
-----
When Devlin Shand opened Queer Arts Featured in the summer of 2022, the historic storefront where Harvey Milk's Castro Camera store was once located had been vacant for a year.There have been calls for the building at 575 Castro St., where the pioneering gay San Francisco Supervisor also lived, to be made the second National Landmark associated with LGBTQ history after New York City's Stonewall Inn. But Shand was never interested in creating a shrine or commercializing its history.
