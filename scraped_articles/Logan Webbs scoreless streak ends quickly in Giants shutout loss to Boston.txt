Logan Webb’s scoreless streak ends quickly in Giants’ shutout loss to Boston
-----
BOSTON — Logan Webb's scoreless streak was bound to end eventually, but perhaps not so harshly.On baseball's oldest stage at Fenway Park, Webb brought with him to the mound on a chilly Tuesday night a 19-inning scoreless streak. The streak had lowered his ERA to 2.33 and laid the foundation for what's transforming into a formidable San Francisco Giants rotation.
That foundation shook in Boston, where Webb struggled to stay ahead in the count and missed his spots — at times badly.
