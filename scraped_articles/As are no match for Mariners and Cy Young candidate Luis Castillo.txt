A’s are no match for Mariners and Cy Young candidate Luis Castillo
-----
With Luis Castillo on the mound for the Seattle Mariners against the Oakland Athletics on a smoky Tuesday night at the Coliseum, the names Randy Johnson and Félix Hernández came to mind.Not to suggest Castillo will match the distinguished careers of Johnson and Hernández, but he has a chance to join them as the lone pitchers in Seattle history to win a Cy Young Award. Johnson won it in 1995, Hernández in 2010.
Castillo (14-7) held the A's to two runs on five hits in seven innings
