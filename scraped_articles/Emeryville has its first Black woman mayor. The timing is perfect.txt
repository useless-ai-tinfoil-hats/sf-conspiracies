Emeryville has its first Black woman mayor. The timing is perfect
-----
Emeryville, the tiny East Bay city between Oakland and San Francisco that most folks know for its IKEA, quietly celebrated a historic moment this month: Courtney Welch was appointed mayor, making her the first Black woman to fill the role in the 127-year history of the community."It's my responsibility to make sure I'm not the last Black woman to be in this position," said Welch, who in 2021 became the first Black woman elected to Emeryville's City Council in over three decades.
