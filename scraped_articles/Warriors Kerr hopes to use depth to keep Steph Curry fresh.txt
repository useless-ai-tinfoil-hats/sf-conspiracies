Warriorsâ€™ Kerr hopes to use depth to keep Steph Curry fresh
-----
The Golden State Warriors are only five games into their new season, but head coach Steve Kerr already sees one valuable byproduct of his team's depth: keeping his marquee players fresher by playing them fewer minutes.Stephen Curry has averaged 34.3 minutes per game in his career and exceeded that number each of the past two seasons. But Kerr kept Curry under 32 minutes in three of the first five games, largely because Chris Paul offers a savvy, stabilizing presence when Curry rests.
