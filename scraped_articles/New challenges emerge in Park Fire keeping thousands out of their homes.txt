New challenges emerge in Park Fire, keeping thousands out of their homes
-----
LATEST July 28, 4:54 p.m. Favorable weather allowed firefighters to make continued progress Sunday on Northern California's Park Fire, which increased to just over 370,000 acres and is currently at 12% containment. However, some challenges lie ahead in the aftermath of new spot fires that picked up along the Highway 32 corridor northeast of Butte Meadows, where crews are encountering steep terrain and heavier, slow-burning fuels exacerbated by conditions that are rife for the blaze to spread.
