Bay Area city that Gavin Newsom threatened finally OKs affordable housing
-----
The Half Moon Bay City Council on Wednesday reaffirmed plans for an affordable housing complex for older farmworkers, successfully avoiding the wrath of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who earlier this year threatened the city with a lawsuit if it didn't act on the project.The move brings an end to a monthslong saga that saw project advocates accuse the city's planning commission of deliberately slow-walking the project, a five-story complex on a plot of city-owned land at 555 Kelly Ave.
