-----
CHICAGO â€” After a week of swirling doubt and semi-panic, punctuated by listless wire-to-wire losses to Toronto and New Orleans, the Golden State Warriors fell behind by 13 points at halftime in the opening game of their road trip Friday night. It was more of the same: They looked meek on defense and hesitant on offense.And then, suddenly, they hopped to life and raced to a much-needed 140-131 win over the Chicago Bulls at United Center.
