Review: S.F. Opera’s ‘Elixir’ is a bundle of comedic charm
-----
Gaetano Donizetti's comedy "The Elixir of Love" is about as filmy and frothy a creation as the operatic repertoire has to offer. It's a piece based on broad jokes, pretty melodies and a bit of romance.When any of those elements miss their marks, "Elixir" can become a trial. But line up everything just so, as the ebullient and imaginative new production at the San Francisco Opera does, and the result is nearly three hours' worth of tuneful, spangly pleasure.
