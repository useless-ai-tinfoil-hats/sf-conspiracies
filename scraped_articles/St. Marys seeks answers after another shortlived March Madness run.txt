-----
SPOKANE, Wash. — St. Mary's cleared several notable barriers this season.The Gaels beat Gonzaga on the road for the first time in six years and won the West Coast Conference regular-season and tournament titles for the first time in 12 years. They also reached the NCAA Tournament in three consecutive years for the first time in program history.
All those firsts still culminated in abject disappointment Friday night at Spokane Arena. Fifth-seeded St. Mary's fell 75-66 to 12th-seeded
