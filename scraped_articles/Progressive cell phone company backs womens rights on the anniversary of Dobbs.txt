Progressive cell phone company backs womenâ€™s rights on the anniversary of Dobbs
-----
Late June brings the second anniversary of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended federal protection of a woman's right to have an abortion. After almost 50 years of enforcing reproductive rights under the U.S. Constitution, the court overruled Roe v. Wade and left individual states to decide the legality of abortion within their borders. In the two years since, 21 states have either restricted the procedure or banned it altogether.
