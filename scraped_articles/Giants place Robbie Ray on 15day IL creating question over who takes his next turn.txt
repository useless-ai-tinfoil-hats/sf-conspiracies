Giants place Robbie Ray on 15-day IL, creating question over who takes his next turn
-----
MILWAUKEE — After a long road back from Tommy John surgery and flexor-tendon surgery, San Francisco Giants starter Robbie Ray is now heading back to the injured list with a left hamstring strain. He was placed on the 15-day IL retroactive to Aug. 26.Ray's spot in the rotation will be pushed to Saturday, probably a bullpen game for at least that game against the Marlins, though it's possible the team could call up Tristan Beck — he's currently on a rehab assignment in Triple-A Sacramento
