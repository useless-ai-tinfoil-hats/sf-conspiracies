With Christmas less than a week away, it's crunch time for both sellers and buyers. For the last-minute shoppers like myself, now's the time to buckle down and order for everyone that's still on your list. The silver lining for procrastinating on your holiday shopping is that retailers offer some of their best prices of the whole year in the final push before Christmas.Take Fanatics for example, where you can save up to 70% on San Francisco Giants gear during a limited-time clearance
