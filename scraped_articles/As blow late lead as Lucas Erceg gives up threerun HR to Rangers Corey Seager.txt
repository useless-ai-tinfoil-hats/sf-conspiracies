A’s blow late lead, as Lucas Erceg gives up three-run HR to Rangers’ Corey Seager
-----
Lucas Erceg has been lights-out as the Oakland Athletics' set-up man this season. He entered Monday night's game with striking numbers in his previous nine appearances: Opposing hitters were only 2-for-31 (.065) against him during that stretch.This time, he faced Corey Seager.
Erceg was one pitch from escaping an eighth-inning jam when Seager crushed a full-count, 92-mph changeup with two runners on base. The ball soared over the right-center field wall, abruptly turning a 2-0
