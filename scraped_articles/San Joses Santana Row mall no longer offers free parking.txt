San Jose's Santana Row mall no longer offers free parking
-----
Since the San Jose mall opened over 20 years ago, Santana Row has offered free parking. On Tuesday, that is no longer the case.The decision was made in response to a similar change at the mall across the street, Westfield Valley Fair, which implemented its own paid parking program in 2022, Collette Navarrette, a spokesperson for Santana Row, told SFGATE. The charge aims "to address the increased number of Valley Fair employees and customers using our parking spaces," Navarrette said.
