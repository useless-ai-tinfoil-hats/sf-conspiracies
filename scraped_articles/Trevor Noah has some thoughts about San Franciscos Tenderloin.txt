Trevor Noah has some thoughts about San Francisco's Tenderloin
-----
Trevor Noah isn't from the Bay Area, but it didn't take him very long to learn that the phrase "from San Francisco" can mean a lot of different things.The former "Daily Show" host is booked for an extended residency at SF's Masonic auditorium, playing a whopping 12 shows, plus one in Oakland at the Paramount Theatre. At Sunday night's show, Noah took the stage around 7:45 p.m. for a tight hour of comedy that was more akin to a recap of his recent travels than a traditional stand-up set.
