Rickwood Field game going to be a tough ticket for Giants fans to get
-----
The Rickwood Field game pitting the San Francisco Giants against the St. Louis Cardinals figures to be a hot ticket. So hot, in fact, that Major League Baseball on Tuesday announced that tickets for the historic June 20 event will be made available only to Alabama residents.Once construction at Rickwood is complete, the ballpark's capacity is expected to be a mere 8,300, and MLB plans to give 26% of the tickets free to community and youth-based organizations in Birmingham.
