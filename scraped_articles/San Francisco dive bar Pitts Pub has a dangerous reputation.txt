San Francisco dive bar Pitt's Pub has a 'dangerous' reputation
-----
If you're heading west from just about anywhere in the contiguous United States, Pitt's Pub is one of the last bars you'll hit before you reach Japan. Sure, you can take a detour and pop by Hawaii, but other than Pitt's in the Outer Sunset, Beach Chalet, the Palace Saloon in Ferndale, California, and a couple bars in Oregon and Washington, you've got a long way to go before you can slake your thirst (side note: If you do take that Hawaiian detour, I HIGHLY recommend Smith's Union Bar, easily
