Bay Area anchor moves from covering Oakland's mayor to working for her
-----
Even as the Oakland A's fight with their home city dragged on for years, KGO-TV reporter Casey Pratt was always on the story. He broke news about developments between the team and Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao on several occasions, consistently breaking down the city's efforts on both TV and on his YouTube channel. He became the predominant Bay Area reporter on the topic, to the point that 95.7 The Game (KGMZ-FM) host Bonta Hill said Pratt should "win an award" for his coverage of the A's.
