Calâ€™s quarterback situation remains unsettled ahead of matchup vs. ASU
-----
Injuries, indecisiveness and inconsistency have hampered Cal's two main quarterbacks through four games this season. But there's one thing you can say indisputably about Sam Jackson V and Ben Finley: Both QBs publicly take responsibility for whatever missteps the Bears' offense has endured."I know there's a lot of room for me to get better," Jackson said during a Zoom news conference Wednesday. "I know I have a high ceiling, and sometimes I really don't play up to my expectations."
