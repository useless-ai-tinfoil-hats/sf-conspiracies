Letters: Yes, Biden is old, but is there a younger candidate who can beat Trump?
-----
President Joe Biden is old, we get it. Hey, Democrats, stop whining about it."We need someone younger," I keep hearing. But here's my question, Who? Oh, no one comes to mind? I hear about the need for someone younger, but no names seem to come to mind.
Lots of names do come to mind â€” for the future. I'm looking at you, Gav.
Let's concentrate on Biden's accomplishments. Let's not forget that he was probably the only person who could defeat Donald Trump.
Biden will beat
