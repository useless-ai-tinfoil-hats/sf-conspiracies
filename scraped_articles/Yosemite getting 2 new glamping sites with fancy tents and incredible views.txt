A pair of new glamping outfits offering overnight stays in luxury safari-style tents are staking their claim outside Yosemite National Park.One of them, Wildhaven Yosemite, opened this spring on a hilly, 36-acre property on Highway 140, about 45 minutes from the Mariposa entrance on the park's western edge. It offers a mix of 30 heavy-canvas tents and 12 cabins, some of which include kitchenettes.
