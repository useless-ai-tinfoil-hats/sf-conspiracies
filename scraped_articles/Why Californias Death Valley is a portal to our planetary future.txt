Why California’s Death Valley is a portal to our planetary future
-----
If the world really is going to hell, please get your brakes checked. The ride will be very downhill.I learned that lesson, among others, after my brakes started to smoke while descending down, down, down Highway 190 into California's answer to the underworld — Death Valley.
I did not run into the Devil on this Death Valley visit. But I did enjoy the otherworldly vistas of mountains, deserts and salt flats in Death Valley locations like Dante's View, Hell's Gate and the Amargosa
