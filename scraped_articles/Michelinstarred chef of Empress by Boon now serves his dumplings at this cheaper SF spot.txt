Michelin-starred chef of Empress by Boon now serves his dumplings at this cheaper SF spot
-----
We're lucky that Michelin-starred chef Ho Chee Boon, originally from Malaysia, thinks that San Francisco "is the perfect city."He decided to settle here with his family after opening the SF location of opulent international Cantonese chain Hakkasan in 2012. After its pandemic closure in 2020, Ho made the grand and risky move to open his own fine dining Cantonese establishment, Empress by Boon, in the former historic Empress of China space in Chinatown â€” still in pandemic times in 2021.
