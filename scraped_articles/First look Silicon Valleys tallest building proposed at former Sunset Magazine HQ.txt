The former Menlo Park headquarters of Sunset Magazine could be replaced by a four-building project that rises to 431 feet, potentially becoming Silicon Valley's tallest building.Developer N17 formally submitted an application for the project at 80 Willow Road, branded as Willow Park, on May 24. It includes 1.7 million square feet of apartments, offices, retail and restaurant space, a hotel, Montessori school and public parks, in one of the most ambitious projects that the city has seen.
