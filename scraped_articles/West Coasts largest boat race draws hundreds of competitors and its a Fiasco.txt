-----
Hundreds of sailboats of various sizes and styles took to the waters of San Francisco Bay on Saturday for the West Coast's largest yacht race, an annual puzzle for participants and spectacle for those watching from the shore.Almost 300 boats met the entry criteria for the Three Bridge Fiasco, so named because skippers can choose their direction at the start and navigate course markings in any order corresponding to the Golden Gate, Bay and Richmond-San Rafael bridges.
