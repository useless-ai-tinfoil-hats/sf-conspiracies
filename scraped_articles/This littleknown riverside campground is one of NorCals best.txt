This little-known riverside campground is one of NorCal's best
-----
On a clear spring day, my partner and I relaxed in camping chairs beside the Trinity River and marveled at a flock of western sandpipers. There had to be 50 of the little birds, all soaring together over the river, swooping down and changing direction in perfect synchronicity, then landing on the riverbank about 10 feet from us.It was only the latest in a series of remarkable experiences on our overnight trip to Tish Tang Campground, an escape into nature at the edge of the Hoopa Valley
