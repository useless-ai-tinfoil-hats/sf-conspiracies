76ers’ Joel Embiid evokes the dominance of ex-Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain
-----
Tom Meschery can appreciate who — and what — he's watching on a near nightly basis from his Sacramento home: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid tearing through opposing front lines the way one former teammate so often would."What an absolute giant he was," said Meschery, 85, reverently referring to former San Francisco Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain. "My guess is that he would just destroy Embiid in the paint.
"He destroyed everybody in the paint."
Like Chamberlain 60
