How to get a handle on your e-waste
-----
Those semi-"disposable" laptops your kids have been bringing home from school? They aren't disposable at all.As a country, we generate about 6.9 million tons of e-waste each year â€” equivalent to throwing out 120 Chromebooks, the relatively inexpensive laptops made by Google that are common in kindergarten through 12th-grade classrooms, every second. We're also throwing out 416,000 phones each day.
This mountain of e-waste leaches toxic heavy metals into our soil and water.
