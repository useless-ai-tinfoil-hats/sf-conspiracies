S.F. streets and sidewalks were clean for Dreamforce. How did the city do it?
-----
If there was trouble at the Dreamforce convention this week, it was mostly just the good kind. As in crowds so big that it was hard to get into some events, and traffic that slowed to a crawl around the confab's nexus of Fourth and Howard Streets in San Francisco.What there wasn't, according to many convention-goers, was mess on the streets to stumble over. Or panhandlers. Or tent camps dotting the sidewalks. Or open-air drug dealing and use.
