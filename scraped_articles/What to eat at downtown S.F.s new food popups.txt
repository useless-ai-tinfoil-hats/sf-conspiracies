What to eat at downtown S.F.â€™s new food pop-ups

Here's food reporter Elena Kadvany.Flipping through books at Green Apple and tucking into one of the Bay Area's best breakfast sandwiches one morning this week felt like a weekend food crawl in the Sunset district. Actually, it was a Wednesday in downtown San Francisco.
I stopped by several of the new pop-ups that have moved into empty storefronts as part of the city's new Vacant to Vibrant program. The goal is to bring new energy (and people and dollars) into hard-hit downtown.
