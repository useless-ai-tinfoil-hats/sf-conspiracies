S.F.â€™s de Young Museum promises changes after man dies outside of heart attack
-----
San Francisco's de Young Museum is rebutting claims that its staff refused to lend its defibrillator to people seeking to help a man who collapsed nearby Sunday of an apparent heart attack, and added that it is now making improvements in reaction to the incident.Museum spokesperson Helena Nordstrom said in an email to the Chronicle that the museum determined that an ambulance had already arrived to attend to Gary Hobish, who was lying unconscious, and so the defibrillator was not needed.
