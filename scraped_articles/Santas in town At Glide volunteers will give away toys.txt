Santa's in town: At Glide, volunteers will give away toys
-----
Barbie dolls. Frisbees. Giant Lego sets. A fluffy pink unicorn.Those are just a few of the 2,000 toys that volunteers will wrap and hand out on Tuesday during Glide Memorial Church's annual holiday toy giveaway.
To prepare for the event, Glide put together an Amazon.com registry and sent it out to donors who helped purchase the items or contributed their own. Corporate sponsors also chipped in, filling the church's pews with teddy bears, Play Doh, dart boards, and dolls in
