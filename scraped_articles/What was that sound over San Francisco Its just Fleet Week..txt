What was that sound over San Francisco? It's just Fleet Week.

What's that booming sound over San Francisco? Is it a bird? A plane? Superman?No, the Man of Steel has not come to save the website formerly known as Twitter from the clutches of Elon Musk. It was just another sign that Fleet Week is here. That roaring whoosh heard over the city was in fact a plane, probably one of several F/A-18 Super Hornets flown by the Navy's Blue Angels. And it most likely won't be the last you hear of them.
Love it or hate it, Fleet Week is in full swing
