Philz Coffee shutters S.F. shop, moves HQ out of the city
-----
Philz Coffee, the popular chain founded in San Francisco in 2003, has moved its corporate headquarters out of the city.Its base is now at its roastery in Oakland. The reason is a familiar one: Like many companies, most of Philz's employees are now fully remote and it no longer needs its Dogpatch offices. A retail location in the same building at 1258 Minnesota St. has also closed.
"Dogpatch has been our home for many years, housing our corporate offices and a retail location.
