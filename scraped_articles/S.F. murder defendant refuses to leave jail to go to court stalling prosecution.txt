S.F. murder defendant refuses to leave jail to go to court, stalling prosecution
-----
San Francisco jail inmates charged with crimes can delay their prosecution by refusing to appear in court — and there's little prosecutors can do about it, according to District Attorney Brooke Jenkins.It's a problem Jenkins is now facing with the case of Dennis James Duree, a 39-year-old San Francisco resident accused of stabbing two people — one 45-year-old man and one 38-year-old woman — in the Mission on Dec. 28, killing the man and seriously injuring the woman.
