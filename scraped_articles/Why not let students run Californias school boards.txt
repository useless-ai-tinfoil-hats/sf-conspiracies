Why not let students run Californiaâ€™s school boards?
-----
California kids, do you follow the news about the culture wars over local school boards?If you do, you'll see these wars portrayed as political contests between groups that want to take education in different directions: progressives and right-wingers, and fights between parents' groups and teachers unions.
But you won't hear much about the role of students in these debates. Because there isn't one. School boards are meetings of adult politicians where kids are rarely ever heard.
