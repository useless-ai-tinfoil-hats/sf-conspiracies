Oxnard gets 3 inches of rain in an hour as storm wallops Southern California
-----
Torrential rainfall in Ventura County, a swath of coastal California just north of Los Angeles, triggered evacuations, flooded streets and homes and brought intense rainfall rates â€” nearly an inch of rain in five minutes at one location, officials said. Portions of streets in Oxnard were under water due to the severe, heavy rains spawned by a low-pressure system that soaked the Golden State."Many of the streets and intersections are heavily impacted by flooding. Please stay off the city
