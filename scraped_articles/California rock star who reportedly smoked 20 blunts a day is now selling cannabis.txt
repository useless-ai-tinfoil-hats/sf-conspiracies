California rock star who reportedly smoked 20 blunts a day is now selling cannabis
-----
Travis Barker might be the most quintessential California rock star alive. As drummer for Blink-182, he created the suburban punk soundtrack for an entire generation. He became an MTV reality star husband to a famous wife, survived a private plane crash and then became a reality TV husband once more to an even more famous wife.So it only makes sense that Barker is now doing what might be the most California thing possible: launching his own signature line of weed products.
