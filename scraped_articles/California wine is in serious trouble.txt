California wine is in serious trouble
-----
Megan Bell felt certain that her winery was going bankrupt.When she released a new batch of wines in August, only three of her 19 distributors agreed to buy any. She was running $65,000 over budget on opening a tasting room in Santa Cruz. And she owed $80,000 to grape growers.
Sales in the second half of the year were the worst Bell had seen since starting her small business, Margins, eight years ago. Bell labeled 2023 "a disaster" and said she knows she wasn't the only winemaker
