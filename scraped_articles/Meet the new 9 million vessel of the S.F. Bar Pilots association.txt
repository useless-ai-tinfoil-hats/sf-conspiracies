Meet the new $9 million vessel of the S.F. Bar Pilots association
-----
In a ceremony full of tradition, optimism and Champagne, the San Francisco Bar Pilots christened a brand-new vessel that goes like the wind but doesn't pollute the air.The vessel is the pilot boat Golden Gate, which will take ship pilots around the bay and out to sea. The ship pilots and their operations are "a key link in maritime trade that moves over $1 billion in goods through local ports,'' said Assembly Member Tim Grayson, D-Concord, one of the speakers at the midweek ceremony.
