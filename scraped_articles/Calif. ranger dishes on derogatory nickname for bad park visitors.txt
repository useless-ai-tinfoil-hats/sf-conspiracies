Calif. ranger dishes on derogatory nickname for bad park visitors
-----
"What is a turon?" someone asked me the other day.With the question came a link to a post in the Yosemite National Park subreddit, which read: "It's the off season, and I'm already seeing [too] much turon behavior in the valley."
Clearly it was derogatory, but it took a bit of research to learn that the word (which is actually spelled touron) is a mash-up of "tourist" and "moron." Urban Dictionary defines it as "any person who, while on vacation, commits an act of pure stupidity."
