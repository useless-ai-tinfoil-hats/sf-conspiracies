If Aâ€™s are to play in Oakland beyond 2024, Thao and Fisher must compromise
-----
Oakland's final chance to temporarily keep a major professional sports team comes down to a Tuesday showdown pitting Mayor Sheng Thao against Oakland Athletics owner John Fisher.Thao already put out a public proposal that Fisher could find unreasonable. He might either offer a counterproposal that will keep the Coliseum talks alive or bolt for Sacramento. We'll find out soon enough whether either has been bluffing.
Fisher's crew will gather with officials from Oakland and Alameda
