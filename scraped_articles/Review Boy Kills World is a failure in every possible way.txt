Review: ‘Boy Kills World’ is a failure in every possible way
-----
There is a kind of film that's funny and absurdly violent and yet still makes you care about the characters. That's what "Boy Kills World" seems to want to be, but isn't."Boy Kills World" is rather the sort of movie that's funny in a way that eliminates all possibility of a serious response and yet violent in a way that wipes out any possibility of humor. It uses violence to compensate for its lack of cleverness and makes feints in the direction of cleverness to deflect responsibility
