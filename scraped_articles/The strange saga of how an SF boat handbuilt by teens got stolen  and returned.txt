-----
The strange saga of a hand-built boat stolen from a San Francisco park and ending up miles away has sparked online fervor and an ongoing investigation by the United States Park Police.A group of teenage girls finished the vessel in July, building it from scratch over about three years through their participation in SF Sea Scouts, an organization that teaches young people boating and leadership skills.
Dubbed "Thanks," the rowboat generally stays locked up at SF's Aquatic Park
