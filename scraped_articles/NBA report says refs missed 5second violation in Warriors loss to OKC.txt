NBA report says refs missed 5-second violation in Warriors' loss to OKC
-----
PHOENIX â€” To hear the NBA tell it, Draymond Green's three-shot foul on Chet Holmgren shouldn't have even happened.That's because the league's "Last Two-Minute Report," in which it reviews down-the-stretch calls, acknowledged the officials missed a five-second violation on the inbounds pass by Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams. If the call had been made, the Golden State Warriors would have taken possession with a three-point lead and 8.4 seconds left in regulation Friday night.
