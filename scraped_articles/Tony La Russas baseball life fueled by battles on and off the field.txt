Tony La Russa's baseball life fueled by battles on and off the field
-----
Tony La Russa lumps every major life change into one of two categories: in uniform, or out of uniform.The former Oakland Athletics manager, who is closing in on 80, was out of uniform in 2020 when the Chicago White Sox surprisingly hired him to manage the team.
"When I got back into uniform in '21, we won the division," La Russa said, "but in '22, I got sick, I had to leave, get out of uniform in August. There were some issues they felt they had to take care of right away."
