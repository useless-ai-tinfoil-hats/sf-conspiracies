From ancient caves to dining rooms, painting makes a statement
-----
There are paintings over 64,000 years old, stencils of hands likely made by Neanderthals, in the Cave of Maltravieso in Caceres, Spain. By the time they got to the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc in France, they drew mammoths and bears. Later, horses, bison and ibex.It's a bit late to ask any Neanderthal: Hey, why did you daub that woolly rhinoceros on the wall? Scientists have guessed that they were totems or made up for a lack of words. A few have suggested graffiti. Archaeologist Abb√© Breuil
