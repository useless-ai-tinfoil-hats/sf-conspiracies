Giants ship inconsistent closer Camilo Doval to Triple-A Sacramento
-----
The San Francisco Giants making a move at closer Friday wasn't totally unexpected, considering Camilo Doval's struggles the past five weeks. What was a surprise was how total the change is: San Francisco optioned the 2023 All-Star to Triple-A Sacramento before the game against the Detroit Tigers.Manager Bob Melvin said the decision was made in order to allow Doval to work on some things — namely, his command — and he will return to the closer role when he is back to his usual form.
