Want to watch a Giants spring training broadcast? Good luck with that
-----
The San Francisco Giants' spring-training television schedule is almost non-existent. Not a single game has been aired so far, the first telecast isn't until next Saturday (when they play against the Oakland Athletics), and just three other games are scheduled to be telecast from Arizona.So you could understand a fan's frustration on Friday when the Giants hosted Bruce Bochy's Texas Rangers. The game wasn't televised, nor did KNBR carry it on radio. NBC Sports Bay Area filled the 12 p.m.
