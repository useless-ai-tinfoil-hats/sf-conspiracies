The Xbox Series X is $150 off at Walmart â€” and arrives by Christmas
-----
Scrambling to turn all those holiday wish lists into reality? Thanks to Walmart, you've now got one more shot at Christmas glory. They've given Xbox's hottest new Series X console a deep markdown, and if ordered today, it can be under your tree in time for Santa. Don't start your victory lap now though. You haven't won Christmas until you hit that blue "Add to Cart" button, and with more than 1,000 sold in the last 24 hours, these things could be gone at any moment.Xbox Series X Video
