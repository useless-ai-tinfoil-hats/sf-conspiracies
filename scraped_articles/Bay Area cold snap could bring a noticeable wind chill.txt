Bay Area cold snap could bring a 'noticeable wind chill'
-----
High surf and light rain are both in the weekend forecast for the San Francisco Bay Area, but the big weather story in the coming days is the cold, according to the National Weather Service.Bone-chilling temperatures are expected across the region Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with many locations seeing overnight lows drop into the 30s. National service forecaster Brayden Murdock said the cold snap will come as northerly winds usher cold air from the Pacific Northwest into the region.
