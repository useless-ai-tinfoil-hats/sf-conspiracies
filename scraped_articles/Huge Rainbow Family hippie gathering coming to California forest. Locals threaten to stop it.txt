Huge Rainbow Family hippie gathering coming to California forest. Locals threaten to stop it
-----
California's remote Plumas National Forest is expected to get a heavy dose of 1960s counterculture in coming weeks as thousands of people from across the country make their way to the annual gathering of the Rainbow Family.Described as the "largest non-organization of non-members in the world," the Rainbow Family is a loose-knit group bonded by such ideals as intentional community, nonviolence and alternative living, with a welcome embrace of tie-dye, patchouli oil and marijuana.
