Letters: Students need to protest Gaza, but not voting? What happens if Trump is elected president?

Regarding "Campus activism is on full display in Berkeley. Voting, not so much" (Joe Garofoli, SFChronicle.com, April 24): As a boomer who protested the Vietnam War in middle school (with my parents), I agree that the lesson from the 1960s-era protests is that voting for Democratic candidates is not enough and that activism is necessary.However, there is another lesson from 1968 that today's activists should heed. Not actively opposing President Richard Nixon made the Vietnam War worse.
