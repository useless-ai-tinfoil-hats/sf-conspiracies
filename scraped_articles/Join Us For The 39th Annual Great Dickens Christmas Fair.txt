Join Us For The 39th Annual Great Dickens Christmas Fair
-----
The Great Dickens Christmas Fair is a time traveler's delight and a one-of-a-kind way to celebrate the holidays. For five weekends only, the historic Cow Palace in Daly City is transformed into the streets and stages of Charles Dickens' London. On Saturdays and Sundays, and the Friday after Thanksgiving, The Great Dickens Christmas Fair will take visitors on an immersive adventure through four acres of Victorian theaters, pubs, and dance halls, encountering hundreds of costumed characters.
