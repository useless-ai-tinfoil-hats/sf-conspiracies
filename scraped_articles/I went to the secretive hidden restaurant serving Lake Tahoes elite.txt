I went to the secretive, hidden restaurant serving Lake Tahoe's elite
-----
Lake Tahoe's new upscale Japanese restaurant, Smoke Door, is unassuming to the point of being almost invisible. The subtle, modern restaurant is inside a single-story building with blackened wood siding. There is no large sign out front indicating what's inside. That's by design.It's also surrounded by chain-link fences, which guard the long-shuttered, vacant casinos that are the restaurant's neighbors.
Located in Crystal Bay, on the California side of the California-Nevada state
