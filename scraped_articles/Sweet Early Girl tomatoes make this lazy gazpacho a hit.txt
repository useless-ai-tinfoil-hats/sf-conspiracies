Sweet Early Girl tomatoes make this ‘lazy’ gazpacho a hit
-----
In spite of its simplicity, gazpacho has a formula — a method of putting it together. The ingredients for this freshly blended tomato soup from Andalusia, Spain, are almost constant: crisp cucumbers, green Cubanelle pepper, bread for texture, olive oil, salt and, of course, juicy ripe tomatoes.Some recipes insist on coring the tomatoes or peeling and seeding the cucumbers. Others say the blended mixture should be strained for a precise "pure" puree. Others will have you chill the soup
