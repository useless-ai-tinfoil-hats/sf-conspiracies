The Cal women committed 21 turnovers, trailed by as many as 15 points and — despite cutting their deficit to a basket on several occasions — enjoyed their only lead after the game's first basket in dropping a 76-71 decision to Arizona State in Tempe on Sunday.The Bears (13-8, 3-6 Pac-12) had trimmed the margin to 71-69 on Leilani McIntosh's jumper with 4:30 to play. But Cal scored only two points the rest of the way in losing for the fifth time in its past six games.
