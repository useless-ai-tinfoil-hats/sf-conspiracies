-----
Stuff, the massive Mission District mall filled with vintage goods including midcentury furnishings, lighting, records, jewelry and other collectibles, is closing soon.But the store's demise is spawning two new Stuff stores — one in San Francisco's Polk Gulch, the other in Albany, the Chronicle has learned.
The new stores — Stuff by Luxe in San Francisco and Stuff East Bay in Albany — both plan to carry on the legacy, style and mood of the original Stuff, operated by Will Lenker
