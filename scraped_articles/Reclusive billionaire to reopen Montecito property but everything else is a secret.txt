Reclusive billionaire to reopen Montecito property, but everything else is a secret
-----
An announcement some Santa Barbarans thought might never come — the reopening of one of reclusive Beanie Babies billionaire Ty Warner's properties — happened last week.In a letter to members of his Coral Casino Beach and Cabana Club in Montecito, Warner gave a timeline for the club being back online. After its closure in March 2020, coinciding with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and a renovation to follow, he said the private club is set to reopen on Jan. 20, 2024.
