Pro-Palestinian protesters occupy abandoned hall owned by UC Berkeley
-----
A group of pro-Palestinian protesters are occupying an abandoned UC Berkeley building near People's Park, just days after a separate group of protesters agreed to dismantle their encampment around Sproul Hall.Several news outlets reported that the group began occupying Anna Head Alumnae Hall on Haste Street directly across from People's Park on Wednesday afternoon. After the building caught fire in 2022, the university boarded up the building's windows and erected a fence around it.
