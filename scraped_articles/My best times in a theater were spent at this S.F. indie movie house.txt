My best times in a theater were spent at this S.F. indie movie house

Hi Mick: What would you say is the change in relevance of critics from major newspapers now versus when you started out at the Chronicle?David Sironen, San Francisco
Dear David: Some of my best memories as a critic — and my best times in a movie theater — go back to the 1990s and the wonderful repertory shows that the Roxie Cinema (now Roxie Theater) put on and that I wrote about: the Norma Shearer tribute, the Lon Chaney festival, the Monta Bell festival, the Hong Kong Cinema
