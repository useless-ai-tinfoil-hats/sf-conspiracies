These British bakers are bringing 'the most delicious food on Earth' to the Bay Area
-----
Megan Twisk has a mission: to spread her love of the sausage roll throughout the Bay Area and beyond. As a British expat, it's more than just about sharing good food. It's a patriotic duty."It's the most delicious food on Earth," she said. "When people talk about the national dish of the U.K., they'll say fish and chips or chicken tikka masala. But I think, realistically, it's the sausage roll."
Twisk made that mission a career in 2021 when she started Mrs. Miggins British Bakery
