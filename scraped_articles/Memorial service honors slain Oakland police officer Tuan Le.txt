Rain spattered a sprawling motorcade that glided toward 3Crosses Church in Castro Valley Wednesday, where elected leaders and law enforcement in dress blues gathered to mourn slain Oakland Police Officer Tuan Le.Four police snipers watched over the church grounds as scores of officers arrived in buses or SUVs or on motorcycles, passing under an American flag draped between two ladder fire trucks. Many looked somber or stoic, remembering the 36-year-old who was shot and killed in the line
