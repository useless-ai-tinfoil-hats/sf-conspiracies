Cheech and Chong are Sacramento K Street lobbyists now. How on brand for our era, man

Let's make a dope deal.Let me rephrase that. Let's lobby for a dope deal.
You may recall, or not, depending on your decades-long marijuana consumption level, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong and their potent weed-based humor from the 1970s. Every teenage boy in the United States then had their favorite routines, and now every 60-something guy can recite vast tracts of cuts from their albums.
"YOU RUINED MY RECORD, MAN! I JUST BOUGHT IT!" would be my go-to Cheech and Chong bit.
