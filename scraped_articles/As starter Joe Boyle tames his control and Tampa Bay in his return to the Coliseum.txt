A’s starter Joe Boyle tames his control and Tampa Bay in his return to the Coliseum
-----
Oakland A's pitcher Joe Boyle was at a crossroads.Two runners in scoring position waited behind him in the first inning Monday, the result of two walks. It could have turned problematic for the A's. Instead, the inning ended on a Junior Caminero groundout as Boyle reset on the mound.
"I just took a deep breath, focused a little harder — typically on where I wanted to throw the ball and throwing it with conviction," Boyle said.
That scare proved the worst Boyle faced all night
