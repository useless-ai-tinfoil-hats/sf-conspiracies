-----
Cal running back Jaydn Ott took a scary fall when he tried to leap over an Auburn defender last weekend, but the Bears learned that he should be ready to play when they host Idaho on Saturday afternoon.Late in the third quarter of the Bears' 14-10 loss Saturday, Ott ran to the left side and got upended by Auburn safety Jaylin Simpson. Ott landed on his back and remained on the ground for a while before walking to the sideline. He sat out the rest of the game.
