Kate Coleman, Free Speech Movement veteran who wrote courageous expos√©s, dies at 81
-----
As the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley reached its culmination with a sit-in at the administration building on Dec. 2, 1964, Kate Coleman sat on the curved marble steps inside Sproul Hall, double-teaming peanut butter sandwiches with Joan Baez to feed 1,500 hungry protesters.At some point Coleman, a senior English lit major from Encino, left her sandwich station to investigate the contents of a file cabinet that had been liberated in the course of the all-day, all-night occupation.
