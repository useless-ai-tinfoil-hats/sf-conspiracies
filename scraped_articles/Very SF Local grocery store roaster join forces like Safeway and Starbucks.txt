'Very SF': Local grocery store, roaster join forces like Safeway and Starbucks
-----
Two San Francisco-based, family-owned small businesses are partnering for a new venture in San Francisco's Mission District to bring together local coffee and grocery shopping. It's reminiscent of when Starbucks joined forces with Safeway to open cafes in-store in the early 2000s but on a local scale.On July 1, Andytown Coffee Roasters will open a new cafe inside Gus's Community Market at 2111 Harrison Street. Who doesn't love grocery shopping with a fresh cup of joe in hand?
