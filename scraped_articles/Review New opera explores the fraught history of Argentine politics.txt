Review: New opera explores the fraught history of Argentine politics
-----
Eva Perón, the glamorous, short-lived second wife of Argentine President Juan Perón, remains the dominant icon for that country's 20th century history. Since her death in 1952, she's been the subject of veneration and revisionism, and served as the central figure of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's hit musical "Evita."But no one has thought to put Perón's third wife, Isabel, at the center of a theatrical work, until now.
