Obviously fake license plate busted by Bay Area cops
-----
A driver was arrested in Benicia, Calif., on Friday morning after a police officer noticed her car had a very obviously forged license plate. What appears to be black duct tape holds the flimsy replica in place on the back of the car, a silver Kia Rio LX.The fake plate, which appears to be fashioned from a sheet of printer paper, has a plate number hand-drawn across it in thick black Sharpie. The digits on the right side of the plate are ever so slightly smaller than those on the left,
