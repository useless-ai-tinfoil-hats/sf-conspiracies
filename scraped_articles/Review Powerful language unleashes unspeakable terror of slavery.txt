Review: Powerful language unleashes unspeakable terror of slavery
-----
The verdant green of the American South and the terror of slavery are the backdrops to Jesmyn Ward's latest novel, "Let Us Descend."It is 1835 and Arese, an enslaved teenager, resides with her mother on a South Carolina plantation. Under moonlight, her mother teaches her to fight like a warrior, for this is all a parent can bequeath while "the sire" of the plantation leers in the distance. When Mama is sold, Arese has visions of a spirit godmother, a duplicitous "white-wreathed woman"
