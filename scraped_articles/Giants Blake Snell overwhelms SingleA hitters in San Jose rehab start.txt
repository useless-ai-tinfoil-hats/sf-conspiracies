Giants’ Blake Snell overwhelms Single-A hitters in San Jose rehab start
-----
Blake Snell's return to action was about as impressive as it could get Sunday at San Jose Municipal Stadium.Snell, who is on the San Francisco Giants' injured list with a left adductor (groin) strain, threw an immaculate inning to start things off — nine pitches, nine strikes, three outs — and worked four perfect innings in all against the Stockton Ports, his fastball registering as high as 97 mph.
Snell said he's never thrown an immaculate inning at any level, even as an amateur.
