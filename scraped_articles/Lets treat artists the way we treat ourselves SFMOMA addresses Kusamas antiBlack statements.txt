‘Let’s treat artists the way we treat ourselves’: SFMOMA addresses Kusama’s anti-Black statements
-----
After Yayoi Kusama's apology for her past writings that contained anti-Black sentiments, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art director Christopher Bedford defended the institution's role in supporting artists.A day ahead of the Saturday, Oct. 14, opening of "Yayoi Kusama: Infinite Love," the 94-year-old Japanese artist's first Northern California exhibition at the institution, Bedford called it a "tremendous leadership opportunity for SFMOMA."
Bedford is no stranger to controversy.
