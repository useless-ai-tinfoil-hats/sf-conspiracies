Richmond council to vote on resolution accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing, drawing criticism
-----
The Jewish Community Relations Council has raised concerns that the Richmond City Council is planning to vote Tuesday on a resolution that accuses Israel of ethnic cleansing and apartheid.Introduced by Mayor Eduardo Martinez and Vice Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, the resolution affirms the city's support for Gaza and calls out Israel for punishing the people there "in response to Hamas attacks." The City Council is scheduled to take up the two-page resolution during its open session on Tuesday
