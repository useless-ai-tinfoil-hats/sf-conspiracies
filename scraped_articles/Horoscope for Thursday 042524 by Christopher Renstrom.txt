Horoscope for Thursday, 04/25/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Weeks of backpedaling end as Mercury turns direct today. You didn't like yielding ground, but you'll soon see how this bought valuable time.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Someone's trying to change the rules. This is what contracts are good for, but double-check the fine print just to be certain.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Ruling Planet Mercury comes out of retrograde today and so do you. Self-doubt and insecurity give way to audacity and derring-do!
