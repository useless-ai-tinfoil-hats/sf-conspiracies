Giants’ Jung Hoo Lee, Padres’ Ha-Seong Kim could both lead off on Opening Day
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Opening Day in San Diego might be quite the event in Korea, too, with Jung Hoo Lee expected to hit leadoff for the San Francisco Giants and his friend Ha-Seong Kim potentially leading off for the Padres."That would be a history moment for Korean baseball," Lee said, with Justin Han interpreting.
Also in the mix: Korean reliever Woo-Suk Go, who is Lee's brother-in-law. Go signed a two-year, $4.5 million deal with San Diego last month.
Lee and Kim are so
