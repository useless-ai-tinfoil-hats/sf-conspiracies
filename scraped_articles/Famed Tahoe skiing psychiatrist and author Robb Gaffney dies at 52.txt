Famed Tahoe skiing psychiatrist and author Robb Gaffney dies at 52
-----
To ski the chutes at Palisades Tahoe requires a hike to the peak from the Siberia chairlift â€” and once there, Robb Gaffney further separated his style from the other steep-terrain skiers.He picked a route down through rock walls on strips of snow that were not wide enough for a turn until he hit a speed of 50 mph at the bottom of a chute or chimney.
This was back in the 1990s, and there were lines in the Palisades terrain section that had never been skied the way Gaffney did it.
