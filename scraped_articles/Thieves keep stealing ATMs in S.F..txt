Thieves keep stealing ATMs in S.F.
-----
A mangled ATM remained on the sidewalk in San Francisco's Mission District on Sunday afternoon hours after thieves forced entry into a drugstore and smashed apart the machine.The ATM appeared to have come from the Walgreens at the corner of 23rd and Mission streets, where a security guard stood by Sunday afternoon as a worker cleared glass shards from a smashed door. It was unclear whether the thieves had taken the contents of the machine before police arrived on scene early Sunday.
