The Bay Area's most expensive burger isn't very good
-----
Selby's, a 4-year-old Bay Area restaurant across the street from America's most expensive ZIP code, is an enigma wrapped in a paradox stuffed in the Winchester Mystery House.It's one of the most gorgeous restaurants on San Francisco's Peninsula. It's held a Michelin star for each of the past three years. And — despite prestige and pedigree — it's responsible for the Bay Area's most disappointing burger.
