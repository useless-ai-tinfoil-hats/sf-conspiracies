Warriors seeking one more surge as play-in picture begins to crystalize
-----
LOS ANGELES — Rookie guard Brandin Podziemski knows it's unlikely that the Golden State Warriors will miss the postseason altogether. They began Friday seeded 10th in the Western Conference and pegged to the final berth in the play-in round: 3½ games ahead of the 11th-place Houston Rockets.But "you don't want to be a 10-seed and have to play two road games to get to an actual series," Podziemski said Wednesday after a 109-99 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
The Warriors have 17 games
