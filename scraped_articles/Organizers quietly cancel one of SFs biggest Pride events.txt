-----
Citing leadership issues, organizers quietly canceled one of San Francisco's most consistent Pride events.June 29 would have marked the 32nd iteration of the San Francisco Dyke March. The annual march, which mixes protest with a celebration of lesbian and queer identity, has gathered at Dolores Park since the 1990s. Typically, the march takes place on the Saturday of Pride week, following Friday's Trans March and ramping up to the climax of Sunday's Pride parade.
