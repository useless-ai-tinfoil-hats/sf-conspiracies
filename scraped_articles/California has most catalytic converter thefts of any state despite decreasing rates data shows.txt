Catalytic converter thefts are down for the first time since 2019, according to national auto claims data from State Farm.For the first half of 2023 there were 14,500 catalytic converter theft claims nationwide, according to the insurance company, compared to 23,000 for the same time last year.
The decline comes after years of increases in the number of catalytic converter thefts as prices soared for the precious metals contained in the parts, fueling an illicit underground market.
