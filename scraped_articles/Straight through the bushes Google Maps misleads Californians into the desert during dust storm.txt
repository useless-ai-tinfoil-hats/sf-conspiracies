'Straight through the bushes': Google Maps misleads Californians into the desert during dust storm
-----
When a group of Californians went to enjoy the recent Formula 1 race in Las Vegas, they weren't expecting to go off-roading on the way back.Shelby Easler, her brother Austin and their significant others were headed back to Los Angeles on Nov. 19 when they used Google Maps. Instead of taking the Interstate 15 — the major highway connecting Southern California to Sin City — the app suggested they take an alternate route to avoid the dust storm that caused major Sunday traffic delays.
