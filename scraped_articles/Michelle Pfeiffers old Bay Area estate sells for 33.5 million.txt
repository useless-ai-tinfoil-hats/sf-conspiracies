Michelle Pfeiffer's old Bay Area estate sells for $33.5 million
-----
A sprawling estate on the San Francisco Peninsula, complete with a creek, a guest cottage and stables, and once owned by Michelle Pfeiffer, sold last week for $33.5 million, records show.The 6,000-square-foot mansion and surrounding 8.7 acres of manicured woodland and lawns are at 100 Why Worry Lane in one of the Bay Area's wealthiest little towns, Woodside. (The cul-de-sac's whimsical name is reportedly a tongue-in-cheek reference to its proximity to the San Andreas Fault.)
