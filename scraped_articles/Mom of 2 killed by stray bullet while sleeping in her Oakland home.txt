-----
A mother of two was shot and killed by a stray bullet while sleeping in her home in Oakland's Laurel District Friday night, District 4 Councilmember Janani Ramachandran confirmed. The tightknit neighborhood is mourning the loss of a "beloved resident," Ramachandran said."It's absolutely tragic," she said. "I understand that every part of the city is experiencing a crime wave but when a bullet enters your home, that's a different level of fear. I want to see a greater sense of urgency."
