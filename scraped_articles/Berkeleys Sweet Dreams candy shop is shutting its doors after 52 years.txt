Berkeley's Sweet Dreams candy shop is shutting its doors after 52 years
-----
Berkeley's Sweet Dreams candy shop is closing its doors for good in January, after more than half a century in business, as first reported by Berkeleyside.In a world geared towards Amazon shopping and drug store candy, the Elmwood shop is a time capsule: an old-school store with candies priced by the quarter- and half-pound. The store's wooden shelves are lined with glass jars of chocolates, gummies and hard candies.
Gary Gendel opened Sweet Dreams' first location on College Ave.
