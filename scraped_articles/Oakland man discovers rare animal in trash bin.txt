Oakland man discovers rare animal in trash bin
-----
Dana Berry's shift picking up garbage by Oakland's Lake Merritt started out pretty normal.Earlier in October, he and other Trash Falcons — volunteers who meet every Sunday morning in Adams Point to remove waste and debris from the 3.4-mile lagoon — did their usual sweep, clearing the wildlife refuge of loose shopping carts, toys and tape recorders. As Berry approached one cardboard trash receptacle and began dumping his haul, however, he heard growling come from the bottom of the bin.
