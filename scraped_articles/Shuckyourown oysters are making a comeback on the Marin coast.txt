Shuck-your-own oysters are making a comeback on the Marin coast
-----
Oyster fans will once again be able to shuck their own briny bivalves at a popular West Marin destination.Oyster bar the Marshall Store (19225 Highway 1, Marshall) will let customers come shuck their own oysters starting the first week of April. They can purchase their own oysters for $2 each and crack them open (with provided knives) on the restaurant's patio, which offers sweeping views of Tomales Bay.
The Marshall Store had not previously offered oyster shucking to customers.
