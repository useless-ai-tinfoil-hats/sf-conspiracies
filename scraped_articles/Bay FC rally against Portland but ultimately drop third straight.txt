Bay FC rally against Portland but ultimately drop third straight
-----
Bay FC do not seem like they mind giving up goals. Head coach Albertin Montoya has said it enough times, and the results have shown it plenty six games in.That's because they are the kind of team that can erase a two-goal deficit quickly. They have fully bought in on a good offense being their best defense, and they do have a good offense â€” an elite offense, even, for an expansion club.
But Wednesday's 3-2 loss to Portland showed why Bay FC cannot be chronically down in games.
