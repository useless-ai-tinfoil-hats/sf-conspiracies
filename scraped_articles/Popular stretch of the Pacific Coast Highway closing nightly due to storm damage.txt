Popular stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway closing nightly due to storm damage
-----
A section of the Pacific Coast Highway in Ventura County is closing nightly for the indefinite future because of road erosion worsened by the recent winter storms.Caltrans said it's closing a stretch of highway between Sycamore Canyon Road and Las Posas Road from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. or later, every night for an undetermined duration.
Closing the road at night, when there's reduced visibility and the danger of changing conditions or growing damage, is a necessary "safety precaution,"
