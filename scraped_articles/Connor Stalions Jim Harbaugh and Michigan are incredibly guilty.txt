The downside of the NCAA allowing college football players to make money off their names, images and likenesses (or NIL) is that we, the people, have been deprived of the trumped-up NCAA infraction scandals that have imbued the sport with so much shady character over its life span. Who can forget SMU receiving the mythical "death penalty" back in 1987? Or USC's Reggie Bush getting his Heisman repossessed because his agent let his parents rent a house for free? Or Florida State, aka Free Shoes
