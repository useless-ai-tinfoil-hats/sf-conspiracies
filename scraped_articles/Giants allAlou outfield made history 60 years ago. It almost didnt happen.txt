Giants’ all-Alou outfield made history 60 years ago. It almost didn’t happen
-----
Sixty years ago Friday, the three Alou brothers played in the same outfield for the San Francisco Giants. In a game at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Matty, Felipe and Jesús, left to right, appeared in the final two innings Sept. 15, 1963.The Alous played a combined 47 big-league seasons, amassed 5,094 hits and made glorious history as the only brothers threesome to play together in a Major League Baseball game.
Easily, however, we wouldn't be in position today to celebrate that
