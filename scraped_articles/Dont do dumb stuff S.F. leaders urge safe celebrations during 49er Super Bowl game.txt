‘Don’t do dumb stuff’: S.F. leaders urge safe celebrations during 49er Super Bowl game
-----
Mayor London Breed and a host of city officials led cheers for the 49ers Friday morning, urging fans to root for the team responsibly and to behave themselves in the inevitably raucous celebration should the team win the Super Bowl and the Vince Lombardi Trophy."We love to celebrate and to have a good time," she said at a news conference-turned rally in the East Cut neighborhood near the Transbay Transit Center. "We want you to celebrate, but we want our city to be safe."
