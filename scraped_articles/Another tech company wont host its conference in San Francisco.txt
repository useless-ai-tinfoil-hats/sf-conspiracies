Another tech company wonâ€™t host its conference in San Francisco
-----
Google is the latest company to relocate one of its annual conferences out of San Francisco as the downtown area struggles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.The company's Google Cloud Next conference will be held in Las Vegas next year at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center instead of at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, a Google spokesperson confirmed in an email to SFGATE.
This year's event was held last week at Moscone for the first time since before the pandemic.
