San Franciscoâ€™s only rainforest reopens after three month closure
-----
A beloved rainforest in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park has reopened after a three-month closure.The California Academy of Sciences temporarily closed the doors to its Osher Rainforest exhibit for infrastructure maintenance earlier in the fall. During that time, the 1,600 animals who call the facility home were removed from the glass dome, which originally opened in 2008, while a large net covered the 100,000-gallon tank housing tropical fish to protect it from falling debris.
