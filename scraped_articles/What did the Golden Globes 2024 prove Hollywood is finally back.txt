What did the Golden Globes 2024 prove? Hollywood is finally back
-----
At the end of the 81st Golden Globe Awards telecast, host Jo Koy, almost in passing, said, "Hollywood is back." It was an interesting little moment because he was not only saying something true, he declared something that wouldn't have felt true just a year ago.That was the message of the Golden Globes on Sunday, Jan. 7 — Hollywood is back — and what made it easy to believe is that no one was consciously trying to promote that message.
It's like when you're getting over a cold.
