Want a private ski lesson in Tahoe? That'll be $1,400 â€” per person
-----
Just over a decade ago, after finishing grad school, a few friends and I took a ski trip to Breckenridge, Colorado. It was as budget as budget can be, sharing a one-bedroom condo and buying most of our meals from the grocery store. To get on the hill, we did what anyone with a love for skiing and not much money did: We clipped tickets in the parking lot, paying people $10 or $15 for the lift ticket off their ski jackets as they left the resort. We'd grab a new plastic wicket from the ticket
