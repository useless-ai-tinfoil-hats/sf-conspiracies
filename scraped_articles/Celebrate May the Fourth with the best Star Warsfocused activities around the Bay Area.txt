Celebrate May the Fourth with the best ‘Star Wars’-focused activities around the Bay Area
-----
Happy birthday to legendary local filmmaker George Lucas (May 14) and "May the fourth be with you."More than just a silly pun, May 4 is when the annual worldwide celebration of all things "Star Wars" takes place and the Bay Area is ground zero for the film franchise — with LucasArts and Lucasfilm campuses residing at the Presidio's Letterman Digital Arts Center and neighboring Skywalker Sound hidden in the hills of northwest Marin County.
