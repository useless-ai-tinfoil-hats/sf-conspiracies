It was twilight on the last day of Outside Lands. Soft orange lights illuminated the Panhandle Stage. An intimate crowd danced to artist Roosevelt's synth-pop beats. And Bella hit it off with David.It was the perfect music festival meet-cute — until Bella left before asking for David's number.
In an earlier era, Bella and David's interaction would have remained a happy hypothetical. Not so in the age of the internet.
The couple were swapping DMs less than a day later, thanks
