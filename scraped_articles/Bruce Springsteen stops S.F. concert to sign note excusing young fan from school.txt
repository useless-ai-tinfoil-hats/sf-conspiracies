Bruce Springsteen stops S.F. concert to sign note excusing young fan from school
-----
Bruce Springsteen did a young fan a huge favor during his San Francisco concert on Easter Sunday.Anticipating that the sold-out three-hour-plus show at Chase Center would run late into the night, making it difficult to wake up early the next day, 11-year-old Genevieve showed up from Alameda with a hand-made sign that read, "Skipping school, sign my note?"
Her father shared photos of Genevieve with the Chronicle holding the sign and Springsteen happily fulfilling the request.
