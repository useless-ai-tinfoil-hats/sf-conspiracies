A decade after murder conviction, S.F. rapper says his lyrics shouldnâ€™t have been used against him

A San Francisco judge ruled Wednesday that the 2012 trial of a local rapper convicted of killing a 17-year-old boy may have been affected by anti-Black bias because of the prosecution's use of his rap lyrics at trial.The result means that Ronnie Louvier, now 38, will get access to additional evidence he can present to a judge tasked with deciding whether or not the bias actually occurred.
Louvier, AKA "Ron Ruger," was sentenced to 43 years to life for the fatal 2008 drive-by
