Marlus Stewart built a life around supporting people wrestling through enormous obstacles. Orphaned at age 11, sober by 35 and running a drug abuse treatment program by her 50s, Stewart had pushed through setbacks with grit and resilience.Asking for help wasn't supposed to be part of Stewart's story. She was the helper.
But in 2019, the unimaginable happened. Stewart's son, her only child, died of suicide at age 50. Then the pandemic hit. Struggling with health issues, she retired.
