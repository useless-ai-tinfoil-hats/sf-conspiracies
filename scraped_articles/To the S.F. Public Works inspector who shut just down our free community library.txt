To the S.F. Public Works inspector who shut just down our free community library
-----
Dear Public Works Inspector No. 078:I write to congratulate you on a job well done in shutting down a menace on San Francisco's streets.
It is not everyone who would have acted as decisively as you did in clearing a sidewalk in Cole Valley of a small bookcase propped against a building that the neighborhood used as a community library.
The wooden bookcase was perhaps 3 feet tall, 3 feet wide and a foot or so deep. It operated on a give-a-book, take-a-book principle.
