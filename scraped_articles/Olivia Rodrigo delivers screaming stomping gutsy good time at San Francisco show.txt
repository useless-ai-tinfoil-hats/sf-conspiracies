Olivia Rodrigo delivers screaming, stomping, gutsy good time at San Francisco show
-----
Olivia Rodrigo knows her place, and this is it.She's sitting on an illuminated lavender crescent moon, suspended by cables, wearing a glittery two-piece, fishnets and Doc Martens; glowing white stars hang all around her. She's singing "Logical," one of several songs the 21-year-old has written about a relationship gone bad, as she floats serenely around the stadium, pausing in each section to wave at the crowd.
