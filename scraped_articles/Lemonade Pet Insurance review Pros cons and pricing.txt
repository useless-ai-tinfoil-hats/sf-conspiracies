Lemonade Pet Insurance review: Pros, cons, and pricing
-----
Lemonade Pet Insurance at a glanceLemonade is a top pet insurance company as its solid accident-and-illness plans are cheap â€” if your pet is young and eligible for coverage. The company currently only offers policies in 37 states, plus the District of Columbia, and it's fussy about insuring older pets. We found it often won't cover pets 10 and over, though exact cutoffs vary by type, breed, and location.
* Standard waiting period: 14 days for illnesses; two days for accidents
