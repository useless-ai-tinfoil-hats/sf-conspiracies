My best friend had dementia and I had no idea. Hereâ€™s how I missed the signs

Fifteen minutes after our appointed meeting time, I sat by myself in the coffee shop. Ever since we were undergraduates, Kate had been punctual. I checked my phone: No text. Ten minutes later, my phone rang. Kate was on Shattuck Avenue, but where was our cross street? Her voice sounded shrill, agitated. Kate had lived in Berkeley for more than 50 years. The coffee shop where I waited had been there almost that long. Minutes later, I looked out the window and saw her parking in a red zone.
