FasTrak fraud alert: Billing notices sent via text are fake, officials say
-----
FasTrak officials are warning that if you receive a purported Bay Area toll bill via text message, it's a scam â€” and you shouldn't click on a link to pay it.The agency that runs FasTrak, which collects tolls for all Bay Area toll bridges and express lanes, recently issued the warning via X, formerly known as Twitter.
The text messages in question say a balance is due and provide a link to click to pay the purported balance. The link misspells the brand name FasTrak by adding a "c."
