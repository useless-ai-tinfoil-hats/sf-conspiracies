New UC Berkeley student housing complex will be first university building with an Ohlone name
-----
A new UC Berkeley student apartment complex will not only add hundreds more units of badly needed housing for graduate students — it will be the first building in the university's history to bear an Ohlone name, chosen in collaboration with a local tribe.The 761-unit complex for single graduate students, 3.5 miles northwest of campus in neighboring Albany, will be called xučyun ruwway (pronounced HOOCH-yoon ROO-why), a name in Chochenyo, the language of the Ohlone people.
