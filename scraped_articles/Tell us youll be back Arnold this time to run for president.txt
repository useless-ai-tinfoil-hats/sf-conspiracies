Tell us you'll be back, Arnold, this time to run for president
-----
Dear Arnold,In the new Netflix action series, "FUBAR," you're terrific as a retiring CIA agent pulled back into a messed-up intelligence conflict because he didn't realize his daughter is also a secret agent.
You also may not realize that, in real life, the door just opened for you to be pulled back into the FUBAR ("Fâ€”ed Up Beyond All Recognition") of our national politics. I'm writing to ask you to walk through that door, and run for president for the good of our country.
