Warriors' Andrew Wiggins looks like he's 'in a fog' in slow start to season
-----
The Golden State Warriors are off to a solid 6-2 start, which includes five wins on the road already and Steph Curry playing like an MVP.But even with the positives, there is one major cause for concern so far: Andrew Wiggins looks like a shell of the player the Warriors saw during their 2022 title run.
While it's still early, Wiggins' per-game averages are down to career-low levels across the board: points (10.8), rebounds (3.4), assists (0.8), steals (0.1), field goal attempts
