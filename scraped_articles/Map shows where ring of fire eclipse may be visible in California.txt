Map shows where 'ring of fire' eclipse may be visible in California
-----
Astronomy enthusiasts across the West Coast and Southwest are preparing for an annular solar eclipse that will likely be visible in the sky on Saturday.An annular solar eclipse — not to be confused with an annual eclipse — occurs when Earth's moon covers up most of the sun. If you're in the right spot at the right time, you'll see just a circle of light around the moon, also called a "ring of fire." (An "annulus" in mathematics is the name for the space between two concentric circles.)
