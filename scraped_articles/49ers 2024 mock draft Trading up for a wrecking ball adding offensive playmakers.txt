49ers 2024 mock draft: Trading up for a wrecking ball, adding offensive playmakers
-----
In San Francisco 49ers history, they have taken two players with the No. 31 overall pick in an NFL draft: Reuben Foster and Rashaun Woods.Foster, selected in 2017, was an off-field disaster whose brief tenure included more arrests (three) than sacks (zero), interceptions (zero), forced fumbles (zero) and fumble recoveries (you'll never guess). Woods, selected in 2004, had seven catches in his three-team NFL career and played in his final game fewer than nine months after he was drafted.
