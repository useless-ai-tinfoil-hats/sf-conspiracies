S.F. just housed a homeless woman in days. It usually takes many months
-----
Natalia Pinto, 66, would rather forget the reasons she came to San Francisco.For years she's been living on the street in the Mission District, relying on neighborhood nonprofits for meals and showers. But the daily inconveniences of being an unhoused older woman on the streets in San Francisco is far better than the horrors awaiting her if she stayed in El Salvador during the 1980s.
"It was all war and constant danger," Pinto said. "This is nothing compared to that."
