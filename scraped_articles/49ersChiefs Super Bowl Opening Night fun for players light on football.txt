49ers-Chiefs Super Bowl ‘Opening Night’ fun for players, light on football
-----
LAS VEGAS — "Opening Night," the first official event of Super Bowl week, is exactly like a football game, but without the annoying distraction of a football game.You get a stadium full of fans, cheerleaders, bands, mascots. I saw Sourdough Sam, wearing incongruous shiny white boots, like Ron DeSantis would wear if he were panning for gold.
You get players, all the players from the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas Chiefs, both teams attired in identical black track suits. How wrong
