‘Inevitable’: Hawaii might legalize pot because of this reason
-----
Hawaii has long had a deep connection to cannabis, yet recreational marijuana is still illegal on the Hawaiian Islands.But that could soon change. On Tuesday, the Hawaii State Senate passed a bill that would legalize cannabis use for all adults and create a new state agency responsible for taxing and regulating the drug's sales. The proposed law is now headed to the state House of Representatives, where it will need to be passed before being sent to Gov. Josh Green for final approval.
