Why a 7-mile-long steel net once ran under San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge
-----
Sept. 1, 1941, was a bad day for the Daisy Gadsby.As the 400-ton lumber schooner from Oregon sailed into San Francisco Bay that morning, the captain and crew of 24 had no idea what lay in store as the vessel veered off course due to fog and a racing ebb tide.
Suddenly, not long after passing under the Golden Gate Bridge, the boat became snared in a giant steel trap. The ship could not move, and its rudder was badly damaged. It was stuck. The captain was forced to signal for help.
