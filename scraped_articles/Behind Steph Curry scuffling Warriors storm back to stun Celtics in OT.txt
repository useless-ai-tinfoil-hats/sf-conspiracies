Behind Steph Curry, scuffling Warriors storm back to stun Celtics in OT
-----
Eighteen months and three days earlier, the Golden State Warriors flexed on the Boston Celtics. Stephen Curry did Steph Curry things, the Warriors clamped down on defense and Curry sobbed in joy as he earned his fourth NBA championship.The Warriors and Celtics met again Tuesday night, a game illustrating how much the dynamics have changed in those 18-plus months.
Or maybe not.
Boston arrived at Chase Center sharing the NBA's best record and departed with an improbable loss.
