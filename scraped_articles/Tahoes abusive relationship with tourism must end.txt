Tahoeâ€™s abusive relationship with tourism must end
-----
Tahoe's relationship with tourism is abusive.In 2022, the region received 17 million visitor days that priced out locals and left an almost complete absence of affordable housing.
Tourism in Tahoe must be meaningfully reformed in ways that support, rather than exploit, the local environment and workforce. These needed reforms may be perceived as radical, but so is the scale of the problem.
Local governments and agencies have the authority to reverse much of this exploitation.
