Horoscope for Thursday, 02/29/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Softening your position gets others to lighten up on theirs. Reaching a mutual understanding doesn't have to be so far-fetched.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Don't let yourself get derailed by an associate's hurt feelings. His mood will change; that deadline won't.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Don't be fooled by that temper tantrum because it's being used as a bullying tactic. You'll find that it's just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.
