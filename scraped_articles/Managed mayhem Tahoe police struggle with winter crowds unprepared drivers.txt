'Managed mayhem': Tahoe police struggle with winter crowds, unprepared drivers
-----
Residents in the towns around Lake Tahoe are fortunate enough to enjoy a relatively low crime rate. Though there is the occasional felony crime, most of the area police departments agree they're well prepared to manage the region's relatively peaceful roads, towns, and communities.Until winter hits, that is.
"We're so short-staffed this year," said Truckee CHP Officer Carlos Perez. "We're going to do everything we can, obviously. But it's all hands on deck. We're going to feel it."
