Andrew Wiggins busts slump to score 31 but Warriors fall to Thunder in OT
-----
The search continues.Before Saturday night's Golden State Warriors game against the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder, head coach Steve Kerr talked about his team's "search for identity."
The Warriors will keep searching after a 130-123 overtime loss, which extended Golden State's losing streak to six games, including 0-5 on their six-game homestand. The Warriors sank to 6-8 on the season, with six of those losses at Chase Center, where they lost only eight games last season.
