A history lover secures a brighter future through Season of Sharing

Most mornings, Charles Hope likes to sit on the fourth-floor balcony of his apartment overlooking the foothills of San Jose and lose himself in a weighty historical tome. Studying history, Hope says, can contextualize the day's events and show us how to avoid the mistakes of the past.He especially enjoys reading about history's great wars, and "how, if ever, we could avoid them in the future," he said. "But as long as ignorance prevails in the world, probably not."
