No. 2 Stanford women fall to USC in Pac-12 tourney championship game
-----
LAS VEGAS â€” The championship T-shirts were red, but not Cardinal red.It wasn't a superstar performance from Juju Watkins that gave USC its second 2024 victory over Stanford in Sunday's 74-61 Pac-12 tournament championship game, but a team effort that shut down the Cardinal, forcing the No. 2 team in the country into a flurry of errors and a second consecutive season without a Pac-12 tournament title.
Stanford (28-5) almost certainly still will be a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
