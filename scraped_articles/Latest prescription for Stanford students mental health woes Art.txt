Latest prescription for Stanford studentsâ€™ mental health woes? Art
-----
Stanford undergrads suffering from anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or loneliness have a new mental health care option: a "prescription" of art.That's the idea behind a new partnership between the university and Atlanta company Art Pharmacy. As a supplement to more traditional offerings such as one-on-one counseling, support groups or medication, students can now get a referral to attend a concert, take a ceramics lesson or benefit from any campus art offering.
