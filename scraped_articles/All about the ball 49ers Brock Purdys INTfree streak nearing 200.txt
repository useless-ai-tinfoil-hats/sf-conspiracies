What statistics matter to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy and head coach Kyle Shanahan beyond wins?Yards per pass attempt? Yards per play? Asked Thursday about a number that offers a barometer of how well the offense is clicking, Purdy didn't hesitate.

And Purdy has come up big when it comes to that stat: He has thrown 190 consecutive passes without an interception
