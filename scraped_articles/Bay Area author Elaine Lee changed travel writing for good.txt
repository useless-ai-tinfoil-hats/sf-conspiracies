Bay Area author Elaine Lee changed travel writing for good
-----
There has been a recent explosion of travel stories from hosts who push borders — ranging from "Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy" to "Taste the Nation with Padma Lakshmi" or Stephen Satterfield's recent series "High on the Hog" — but no one else in the Bay Area shaped the world of travel writing quite like Elaine Lee.The long-time Berkeley resident expanded the horizons for Black women travel in 1997 with her seminal collection "Go Girl: The Black Woman's Book of Travel and Adventure."
