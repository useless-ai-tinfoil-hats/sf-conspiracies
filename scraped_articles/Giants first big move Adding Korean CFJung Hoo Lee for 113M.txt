The San Francisco Giants made their first big splash of the offseason and found their center fielder.Jung Hoo Lee, who batted .340 over seven seasons in South Korea and is considered a solid defender and baserunner, agreed to a six-year, $113 million contract.
Lee, 25, bats left-handed, throws right-handed and fits what president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi was looking to add this winter: He's young, is an all-around player who could bat at the top or middle of the lineup
