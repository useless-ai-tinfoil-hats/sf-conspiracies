Horoscope for Wednesday, 04/17/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You gave a venture your best shot so there's no shame in calling it quits. Ironically this "setback" frees you to move on to something more worthwhile.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): How many times have you said no recently? You need to reverse the ratio of noes to yeses and accent the positive.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): A little banter is OK, but the idea is to amuse and not annoy. Remember that there's a difference between smart and smart-alecky.
