West Portal street changes halted after S.F. backlash to let new committee weigh in
-----
San Francisco Supervisor Myrna Melgar has negotiated a truce with West Portal residents and merchants who opposed plans to redesign a key intersection in their neighborhood, rerouting traffic to open more space for cyclists and pedestrians.Instead of moving the plan forward, residents and business leaders will form a committee to evaluate impacts to parking and traffic congestion, and "come to a consensus that works for all parties," according to a statement from Melgar's office.
