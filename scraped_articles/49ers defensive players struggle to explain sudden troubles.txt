49ersâ€™ defensive players struggle to explain sudden troubles
-----
Even if it was only one play early in the first quarter, with little enduring impact on the outcome, Joe Burrow's clever escape from a near-certain sack vividly conveyed the state of the San Francisco 49ers' defense.Arik Armstead momentarily had both arms wrapped around Burrow. Nick Bosa missed a clear shot. Javon Hargrave briefly was within reach. And they all came up empty, as Burrow slithered away and improbably completed a 10-yard pass to Tee Higgins for a Cincinnati first down.
