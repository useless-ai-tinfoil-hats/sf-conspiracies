Why do movie critics write such lengthy reviews?
-----
Dear Mick: Why do movie critics seem compelled to give lengthy movie reviews? You wrote recently about movies in 2023 you considered worthwhile watching, and those paragraph-or-two reviews were excellent. Your condensed versions were more than adequate to decide if I wanted to see the movie.Pat Kearns, San Rafael
Dear Pat: I know you mean that in a nice way, but how do you think Tolstoy would feel if you told him that "War and Peace" was better in the CliffNotes edition?
