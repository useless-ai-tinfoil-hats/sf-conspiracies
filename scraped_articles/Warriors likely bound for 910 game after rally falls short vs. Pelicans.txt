Warriors likely bound for 9-10 game after rally falls short vs. Pelicans
-----
One night after rallying to overcome a sloppy effort in Portland, the Golden State Warriors could not pull off an encore Friday night against New Orleans.And this one could prove costly.
The Warriors fell 114-109 to New Orleans at Chase Center, in a game with enormous implications for postseason seeding. Stephen Curry scored 33 points, but Golden State could not overcome the dynamic combination of CJ McCollum (28 points) and Zion Williamson (26).
The loss struck a severe blow
