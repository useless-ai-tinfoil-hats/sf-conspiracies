California water officials warn of potentially low supplies next year
-----
California water officials on Friday provided a conservative estimate of how much water they expect to deliver from state reservoirs next year: just 10% of what was requested.The low projection, state officials say, is the result of a slow start to the still early wet season. The actual amount of water that will be sent to suppliers, from the Bay Area to Southern California, could go up from the initial estimate once rain and snow levels are tallied next spring.
