Letters: The University of Californiaâ€™s highest-paid employees are sports coaches. That shows its priorities

Regarding "These are the highest-paid University of California employees" (Data, SFChronicle.com, Nov. 6): As a UC Berkeley student, words cannot describe how outraged I am to see these numbers.It is infuriating that the three top-paid employees are sports coaches and the University of California would rather spend $14 million on them instead of putting that funding into our academics and other public services for our schools.
Every day, I watch the university put profit over
