It seems that Grateful Dead founding member Bob Weir enjoyed his time at the San Francisco 49ers game so much, he's decided to follow the team to Las Vegas. On Wednesday, Dead & Company, an offshoot of the legendary San Francisco band, announced they're reuniting for a Vegas residency at the Sphere.Last summer, Dead & Company embarked on a farewell tour, culminating with a final show at San Francisco's Oracle Park. At the time, it was believed to be their final performance together.
