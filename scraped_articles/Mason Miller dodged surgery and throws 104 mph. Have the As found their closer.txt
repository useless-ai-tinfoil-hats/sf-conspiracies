Mason Miller dodged surgery and throws 104 mph. Have the Aâ€™s found their closer?

An ulnar collateral ligament strain is bad news in baseball, usually leading to Tommy John surgery. In Mason Miller's case, such an injury instead led to a new role with the Oakland Athletics, one that he's crushing.The right-hander was shut down in May and got extended rest, then came back with a limited workload in August, with his final two appearances coming out of the bullpen. This year he powered his way into the closer's job, and early indications are that he could be dominating.
