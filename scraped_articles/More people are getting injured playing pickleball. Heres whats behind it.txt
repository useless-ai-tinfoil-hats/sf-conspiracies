Ron Friedman remembers the exact moment he hurt his right knee."It was in the middle of a pickleball rally, and I aggressively moved toward the ball and made a sort of twisting movement and I felt it right then," Friedman said of the match in February at Palo Alto's Mitchell Park. "It happened in an instant."
