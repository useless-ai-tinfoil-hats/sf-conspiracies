Where is Giants catcher Tom Murphy? He’s not sure a 2024 return is in the cards
-----
Patrick Bailey's right oblique strain is testing the San Francisco Giants' catching depth. Unless the Giants can sign free-agent catcher Elías Díaz, they'll have to rely on backups Curt Casali and Jakson Reetz to hold it down during a key road trip through Seattle and Milwaukee with their bid to earn a National League wild-card spot hanging in the balance.Much to his dismay, Tom Murphy won't be able to help. Murphy, 33, has been on the injured list with a left knee sprain since May 5.
