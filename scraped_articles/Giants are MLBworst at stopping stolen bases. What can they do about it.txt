Giants are MLB-worst at stopping stolen bases. What can they do about it?
-----
Opponents have been running wild against the San Francisco Giants. They've given up 91 stolen bases, by far the most in the major leagues. But there are options they might use as they try to stem the tide on the bases, including some increasingly out-of-fashion tactics.One: throwing over, something pitchers do little of now that they're limited to two non-out-producing throwovers per baserunner.
Two: pitchouts, which are typically called from the bench.
