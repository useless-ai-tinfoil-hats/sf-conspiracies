Can Cameron Brink lead Stanford back to top before making WNBA leap?
-----
Cameron Brink doesn't know whether this is her last season at Stanford. She could declare for the WNBA draft as a potential top pick next spring, but she knows the league will be there a year later, too.One thing is certain: The Cardinal offense will run through Brink this season, and Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer will need her to give a strong effort. A candidate to win the national player of the year award, Brink is going to be expected to produce more than ever after Stanford
