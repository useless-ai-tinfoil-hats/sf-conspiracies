Giants’ Alex Cobb goes to IL but playoffs possible; Kyle Harrison back up
-----
PHOENIX — Alex Cobb's regular season is over, but the San Francisco Giants' All-Star starter isn't ruled out for any potential postseason appearances yet, and he was delighted by that news."I'm happy to hear that," Cobb said. "I'm monitoring the next four to five days and seeing how things are going, and if I can start ramping it back up again, I'd be absolutely thrilled to do that."
Cobb was placed on the injured list Wednesday, so he won't pitch the rest of the regular season,
