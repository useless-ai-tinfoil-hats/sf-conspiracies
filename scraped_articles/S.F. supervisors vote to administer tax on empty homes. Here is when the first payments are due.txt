-----
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors paved the way Tuesday for the launch of a progressive tax targeting thousands of homes that sit vacant throughout the city.The so-called Empty Homes Tax, or Proposition M, targets apartments in buildings with three or more units that are vacant for more than 182 days in a tax year. Hailed as one strategy to address San Francisco's housing crisis, it was approved by a majority of the city's voters in November.
