-----
WASHINGTON — Tropical storm Debby's remnants made their way over Nationals Park and sent Thursday's series finale in disarray and chaos.A pair of rain delays totaling two hours prolonged a hectic ninth and 10th innings that featured clutch hits, a blown save and, ultimately, the San Francisco Giants' 9-5 win over the Washington Nationals. Not only did it clinch the series, but secured a winning 5-2 road trip and a bump one game back over .500.
"Today said a lot," Mark Canha said.
