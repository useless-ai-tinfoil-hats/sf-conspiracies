The best luggage deals to shop now
-----
Every trip comes with its own unique luggage needs. Weekend long roadtrip? You'll probably be fine with just a weekender bag. Going abroad for a few weeks? Time to grab a larger checked bag or even a full luggage set. Traveling domestic for a week or less? You can probably get away with just a carry-on (though you might want to bring along a travel tote too). Unfortunately, stocking up on every style of luggage doesn't exactly come cheap.That's why we keep an eye out for the best luggage
