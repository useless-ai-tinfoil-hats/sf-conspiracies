Steve Garvey is ‘The Invisible Man’ of California Senate race. Why is he even running?
-----
You remember Steve Garvey.He used to be a solid first baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers back in the 1970s and '80s, but where is he now?
Oh, that's right. He's the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from California, and his opponent, Rep. Adam Schiff hasn't had to lift a finger.
Because Garvey hasn't lifted a finger.
For example, Garvey didn't attend the state GOP convention in Burlingame last weekend. Of course, the convention made the "Star Wars" cantina scene
