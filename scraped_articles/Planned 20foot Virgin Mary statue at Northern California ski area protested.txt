-----
A plan to erect a statue of the Virgin Mary at privately owned Northern California ski park has been met with an online petition to stop it.The 20-foot statue was a project envisioned by Robin and Ray Merlo, owners of Mt. Shasta Ski Park on the flank of Mount Shasta in Siskiyou County, according to a statement on the resort's social media accounts.
Ray Merlo died in 2020, three years after the couple bought the park, and the statue is to be installed at the top of the Douglas Butte
