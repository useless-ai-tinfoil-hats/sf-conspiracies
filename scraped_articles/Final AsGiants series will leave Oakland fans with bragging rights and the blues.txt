Final Aâ€™s-Giants series will leave Oakland fans with bragging rights and the blues
-----
It's one of the worst and most regrettable developments in Bay Area sports history, so wrong on so many levels. What was sacred and secure and stimulating and even spectacular for 57 years is all going away in a matter of weeks.The Oakland Athletics deserve to be here every bit as much as the San Francisco Giants do. But bad decision-making and personal greed have ruined our humble two-team market that will soon be cut in half, which is a damn shame.
As a result, the A's and Giants
