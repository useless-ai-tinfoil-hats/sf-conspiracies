He found a skeleton in a Hawaii cave, and then spent his life trying to protect it
-----
Keoni Alvarez was just an 8-year-old boy when his Native Hawaiian family made a startling discovery 35 years ago. Deep in the forests of the Big Island of Hawaii, his brothers found a hidden cave when they were playing near their home in Puna â€” and inside the cave, they found iwi, or human skeletal remains.Their mother called the police, and with the help of a state archaeologist, they determined that it wasn't a missing person or homicide but part of an ancient Hawaiian burial.
