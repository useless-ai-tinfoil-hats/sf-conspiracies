Loi's Vietnamese Restaurant in San Francisco, known for hefty bowls of hot pho, has permanently closed after 35 years.The Outer Sunset fixture quietly shuttered late last month after the owners decided to seek retirement, according to Tablehopper, which first reported news of the closure. A local Nextdoor post flagged the closure with a post that shared a photo of restaurant tables and chairs with a "for free" sign as well as an image of the goodbye message posted on the storefront.
