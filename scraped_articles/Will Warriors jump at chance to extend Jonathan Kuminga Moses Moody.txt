Will Warriors jump at chance to extend Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody?
-----
One contract extension consummated.Two more to go.
Potentially, anyway, for the Golden State Warriors.
Having signed point guard Stephen Curry to a one-year extension through 2026-27 on Thursday afternoon, the Warriors can also extend the contracts of forward Jonathan Kuminga and swingman Moses Moody before the 2024-25 season begins. The 2021 draftees are preparing for their fourth season, making them eligible for rookie-scale extensions that can last as long as five seasons.
