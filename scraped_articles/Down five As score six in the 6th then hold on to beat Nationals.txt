Down five, A's score six in the 6th then hold on to beat Nationals
-----
Back in June 2021, when Bob Melvin still was the Oakland Athletics' manager, when the Matts — Chapman and Olson — were the A's starting corner infielders and Sean Murphy was their starting catcher, Oakland won five straight series.The A's hadn't won more than two consecutive series since then before they scored six times with two outs in the sixth inning against Washington at the Coliseum on Sunday to overcome a 6-1 deficit and pull out a 7-6 decision.
That gave Oakland two wins in
