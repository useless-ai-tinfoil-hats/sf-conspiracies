Bay to Breakers race takes over San Francisco's streets
-----
One of San Francisco's signature events took to the streets Sunday, filling the city with runners attired in salmon costumes, wedding dresses or nothing at all. Bay to Breakers, a 12K race from the Embarcadero to Ocean Beach, has been run in the city since 1912.Runners left the starting line at 8 a.m., with the first finishers reaching Ocean Beach in less than 40 minutes. Less serious athletes meandered through the hills of San Francisco, stopping for the occasional tipple along the way.
