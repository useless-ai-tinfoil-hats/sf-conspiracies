California lieutenant governor targeted in ‘swatting’ call after she pushed to remove Trump from ballot
-----
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the target of a "swatting" call over the weekend in which someone placed a 911 call to falsely report an emergency."I can confirm that the LG's San Francisco (home) was swatted last weekend," Aleksandra Reetz, a spokesperson for Kounalakis, told the Chronicle Thursday. "The Lt. Governor and her husband were not home at the time, but their two college-age sons were at the home when law enforcement responded."
