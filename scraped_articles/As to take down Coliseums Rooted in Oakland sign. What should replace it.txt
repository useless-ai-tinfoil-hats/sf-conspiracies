A’s to take down Coliseum’s ‘Rooted in Oakland’ sign. What should replace it?
-----
The Oakland Athletics' "Rooted in Oakland since '68" signs are about to get uprooted.That's one small ray of sunshine the A's will provide for the good folks of Oakland and the Bay Area.
About a zillion cars zip or crawl past the Oakland Coliseum every day on Interstate 880, and everyone in every car and truck is exposed to an obscene sign, the huge "Rooted in Oakland since '68" painted on the west wall of the ancient Coliseum.
That sign is an artifact of an ad campaign
