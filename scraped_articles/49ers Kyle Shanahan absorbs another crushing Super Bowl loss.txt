49ers’ Kyle Shanahan absorbs another crushing Super Bowl loss
-----
LAS VEGAS — San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan spent most of Sunday's Super Bowl alone with his headset. He walked along the sideline, as he typically does during games, scheming and plotting and verbalizing plays into the earpiece of quarterback Brock Purdy.Shanahan's players and other coaches left him alone, letting the boss do his thing — only to see it again lead to crushing disappointment on professional football's biggest stage.
The 49ers lost 25-22 to Kansas City
