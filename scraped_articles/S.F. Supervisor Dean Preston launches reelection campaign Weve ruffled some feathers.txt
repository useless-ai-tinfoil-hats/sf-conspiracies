S.F. Supervisor Dean Preston launches reelection campaign: ‘We’ve ruffled some feathers’
-----
Hundreds of supporters of San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston rallied voters and knocked on doors across District 5 on Sunday morning as the progressive formally launched his reelection campaign."You elected me to be an independent voice in City Hall, standing up against the status quo, and we've been heard," Preston told the crowd assembled at Baker and Fell streets, at the tip of Golden Gate Park's Panhandle. "We've been heard so loud, apparently we've ruffled some feathers."
