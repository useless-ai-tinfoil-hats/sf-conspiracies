49ers will keep Super Bowl practices at UNLV despite field condition
-----
LAS VEGAS â€” The San Francisco 49ers have had concerns about the practice fields at UNLV they are scheduled use this week in preparation for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday against the Chiefs, but they don't plan to use another location.Sod was recently placed over the artificial turf fields, and the 49ers believe the grass surface is too soft. The 49ers did have a walk-through practice at UNLV early Monday afternoon. Head coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday night that the surface is improving.
