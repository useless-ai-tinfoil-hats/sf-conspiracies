Traveling near and far, Metro teams a win away from state-title shots
-----
It's 250 miles from San Francisco to Strathmore, and culturally, the distance is probably even greater.But Lincoln football coach Phil Ferrigno is all-in on his team's long journey to play Saturday in a Northern California championship game. His Mustangs, three-time state and 14-time San Francisco Section champions, travel to Tulare County to face the Spartans for the 7-A title.
The winner will play the winner of the Southern California game between Jordan-Los Angeles and Bell
