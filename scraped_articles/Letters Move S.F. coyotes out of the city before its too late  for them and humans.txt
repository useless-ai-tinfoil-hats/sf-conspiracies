Letters: Move S.F. coyotes out of the city before it’s too late — for them and humans
-----
When I moved to San Francisco 50 years ago, no coyotes were living in the city. Now coyotes are everywhere and their population is increasing.The other day I saw a cat that a coyote had shredded along the bay. A month ago, I encountered a raccoon along Buena Vista West that a coyote eviscerated.
Last spring, I had the misfortune of running into a coyote in Golden Gate Park that must have been protecting pups because she stared me down and followed me as I backed away. It was scary.
