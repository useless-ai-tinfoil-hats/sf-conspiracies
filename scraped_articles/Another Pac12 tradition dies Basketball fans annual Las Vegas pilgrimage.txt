Another Pac-12 tradition dies: Basketball fans’ annual Las Vegas pilgrimage
-----
LAS VEGAS — Harold Rollin stood in the concourse high above the court at T-Mobile Arena, wearing a Cal sweatshirt and sharing his personal connection to the Pac-12 men's basketball tournament.Rollin and his dad, a UCLA alum, went in 2002 when the conference resurrected the event in Los Angeles. They kept going year after year, and from a father-son tandem the group grew to as many as 29 people at one point. They wore their school colors, renewed friendships, bonded over college hoops.
