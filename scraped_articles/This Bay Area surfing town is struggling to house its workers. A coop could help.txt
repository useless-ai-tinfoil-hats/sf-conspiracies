This Bay Area surfing town is struggling to house its workers. A co-op could help
-----
A row of 27 white RVs parked on a dusty parcel off a dirt road is hardly the laid-back sun-kissed surf town vibe that people associate with the West Marin town of Bolinas.But for locals who understand how the town works — its culture, its economy, its schools — what happens with those RVs and the people who live in them has as much to do with the town's well-being as the historic downtown's saloon and hardware store, or the tidal estuary that makes up the Bolinas lagoon.
