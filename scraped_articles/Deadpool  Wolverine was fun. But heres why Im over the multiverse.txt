‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ was fun. But here’s why I’m over the multiverse
-----
I have multiverse exhaustion. Or at least this reality's version of me does.I have nothing against the theory that our existence is but a single part of a branch of infinite universes. I'm not a cosmologist (cosmetologist?), or whatever the word is for studying the origins of the universe, so it's not like I disagree with the quantum mechanics or astrophysics of the proposition. But with the recent release of "Deadpool & Wolverine," yet another Marvel Cinematic Universe film, I'm tired
