ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You're surprised to discover that someone you'd given up on never gave up on you. It may have been on a low flame but what was on the back burner will soon come to a boil.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You're the one nay in a room full of yeas, so confer with someone who isn't involved before changing your position. You need an outsider's perspective.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Were you better off not knowing? It's a legitimate question after sitting
