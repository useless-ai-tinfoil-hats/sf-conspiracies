What happens to your solar panels during the eclipse?
-----
Saturday's eclipse could take a brief but impactful bite out of one of California's most potent and promising sources of renewable energy: solar.The moon will begin crossing between sun and earth around 8 a.m., possibly diminishing solar power generation from millions of rooftop panels and big solar farms by as much as 75%.
"It's going to hammer solar and create a lot of interesting graphs," said Michael Wara, director of Stanford University's climate and energy policy program.
