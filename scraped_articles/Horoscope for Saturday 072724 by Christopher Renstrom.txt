Horoscope for Saturday, 07/27/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Make time for something you claim you have no time for. The sooner you take care of it, the better. Procrastination costs.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Money is money. What you're looking for is a fit between what you want and what a client can afford. Feelings have nothing to do with it.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Are you being inflammatory or protecting interests? It's very important that your motivations be pure now. If not, they could cost big.
