Horoscope for Tuesday, 08/06/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): A high maintenance client isn't worth the trouble. Chances are you could find a suitable replacement if you went looking, so look.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Is it someone's lack of enthusiasm or lack of effort that's got you down? With friends like this, who needs apathy?
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You can expect more than just a few mixed signals with retrograde Mercury approaching Venus. It will be more like a jamming of frequencies!
