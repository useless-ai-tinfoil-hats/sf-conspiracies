Horoscope for Tuesday, 02/27/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You're not happy with the end result but if you review the original wish you wished you'll see that it's been fulfilled â€“ despite its unlikely outcome.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You get twice as much done and for half the effort, but you'll still have to share the spoils.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Don't worry if people quit the negotiating table in a huff. They'll be back. Dramatic exits betray how limited their repertoire really is.
