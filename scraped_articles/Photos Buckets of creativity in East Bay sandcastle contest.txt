Photos: Buckets of creativity in East Bay sandcastle contest
-----
Creativity came in many shapes Saturday as an ambitious crowd, limited only by imagination and materials found on an East Bay beach, competed in a sand sculpture contest.Contestants had up to three hours to build the best sculpture strictly from sand, wood, rocks, shells and other items existing naturally on Robert W. Crown Memorial State Beach in Alameda. Glass and live animals were prohibited. Flowerpots, milk cartons and buckets were allowed, but only to create forms.
