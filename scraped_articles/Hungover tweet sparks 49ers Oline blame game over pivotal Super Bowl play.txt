Hungover tweet sparks 49ers O-line blame game over pivotal Super Bowl play
-----
A hungover tweet from 49ers guard Jon Feliciano kicked off a social media discussion between San Francisco linemen over who's to blame for missing a pivotal block in the Super Bowl.That missed block came on what would become the final play of the season for the Niners' offense. On a third-and-4 from about the Chiefs' 9-yard line in overtime, Kansas City's star defensive tackle Chris Jones broke through the San Francisco offensive line untouched and forced an errant ball from Brock Purdy.
