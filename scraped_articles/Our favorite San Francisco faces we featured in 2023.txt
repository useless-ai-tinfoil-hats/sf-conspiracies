Our favorite San Francisco faces we featured in 2023
-----
Say what you want about San Francisco's "doom loop" narrative in 2023, but we found a lot of optimism via the faces that we photographed this year.Looking back over our images from these past 12 months, we keep coming back to the portraits in particular, and the many vibrant personalities that they featured.
Whether we captured locals partying or protesting (or just cooking cheesesteaks) we found them to be a very photogenic reminder of what a dynamic place the Bay Area can be.
