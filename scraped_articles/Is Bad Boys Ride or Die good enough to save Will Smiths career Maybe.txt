Is ‘Bad Boys: Ride or Die’ good enough to save Will Smith’s career? Maybe
-----
"Bad Boys: Ride or Die," the fourth in a franchise that dates back to 1995, is a pretty good movie from the standpoint of the audience. It's an even better one for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.For Lawrence, it's a showcase that allows him to be frenetic and extreme and occasionally very funny — of the two cops, he's the one who has the most to do onscreen. For Smith, it's a chance to stop the downward spiral his career has been on since he slapped Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards
