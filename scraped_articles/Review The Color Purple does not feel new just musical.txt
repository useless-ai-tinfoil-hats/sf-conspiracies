Review: ‘The Color Purple’ does not feel new, just musical
-----
Nearly four decades after Steven Spielberg adapted Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Color Purple" into a flawed film with some bright spots, a new film version has arrived with virtually the same qualities, only set to music.Danielle Brooks ("Orange Is the New Black") and Taraji P. Henson ("Empire") provide the best moments in this movie musical, directed by Blitz Bazawule (Beyoncé's "Black Is King") and drawn from the 2005 Broadway musical adaptation of Walker's book.
