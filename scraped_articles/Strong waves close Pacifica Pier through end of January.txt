Strong waves close Pacifica Pier through end of January
-----
Last week's mighty waves and high tides caused enough damage to the Pacifica Municipal Pier to warrant its closure for the next several weeks, officials announced.Pacifica's Public Works Department said in a Thursday press release that "a combination of high tides and large waves" damaged the pier's west-facing deck and concrete railing on Dec. 28. After an engineer-conducted assessment, it was concluded that the pier is unsafe for visitors, and will be closed from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26.
