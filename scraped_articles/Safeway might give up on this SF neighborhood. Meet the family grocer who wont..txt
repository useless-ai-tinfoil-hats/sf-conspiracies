Safeway might give up on this SF neighborhood. Meet the family grocer who won't.
-----
It's easy to get lost wandering the aisles of San Francisco's Jai Ho Indian Grocery. With its amply stocked shelves of spices, teas and coveted snacks, the city's largest Indian grocery store is the go-to market for hard-to-find, authentic goods.In an era of ever-increasing big chain grocery prices, neighborhood markets like Jai Ho are the last bastion of affordability, a place where you can load up on fruits, vegetables, rice and oil for far less than you'd pay at a Safeway or Lucky.
