Buster Posey takes big swings at Pebble Beach; will Giants do the same?
-----
PEBBLE BEACH — Buster Posey didn't hold back. He figured this is his third time playing in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, so he might as well let it rip.That's what Posey did Friday on No. 18, crushing his drive pure and long and safely down the famous fairway. Then he unleashed another mighty swing, trying to reach the green in two shots … only to see the ball sail into the Pacific Ocean.
Maybe this counts as a reminder for the San Francisco Giants: Be aggressive, to a point.
