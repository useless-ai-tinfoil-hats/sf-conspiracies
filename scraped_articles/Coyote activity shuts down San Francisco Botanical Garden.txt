‘Coyote activity’ shuts down San Francisco Botanical Garden
-----
The San Francisco Botanical Garden was closed Sunday due to "coyote activity," park officials said."Out of an abundance of caution, San Francisco Botanical Garden is currently closed due to coyote activity," a notice on the Gardens of Golden Gate Park website said. "Thankfully everyone is safe."
It was unclear what specifically had prompted the closure or how long it would last. Tickets were not available Sunday on the garden's website.
