Horoscope for Friday, 12/29/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): It's rare when you feel so attuned to who you are and what you're about. Let this feeling act as your internal gyroscope.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Others are having a crazy time of it, but not you. Today's Venus/Pluto sextile makes you impervious to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): The fact that you tried to do the right thing is what wins over people. This proves more valuable than any victory would.
