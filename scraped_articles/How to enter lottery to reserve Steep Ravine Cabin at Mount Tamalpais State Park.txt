It just became easier to nab one of the holy grails of camping in the Bay Area.California State Parks rolled out a new system for reserving a Steep Ravine cabin at Mount Tamalpais State Park, a rare overnight adventure inside one of 10 miniature coastal chalets (nine seem to be currently available). The new lottery-style reservation drawing system is already in effect and you can begin selecting dates up to eight months in advance.
The revamped system is a welcome change for anyone
