Old-school Japanese flavor with Hawaiian spirit: No other Bay Area restaurant is like this one
-----
Chad and Monica Kaneshiro are some of the most singular chefs cooking on the Bay Area's Peninsula. I constantly fantasize about the plump garlic shrimp and salty-sweet fried chicken plates from Diamond Head General Store, the restaurateurs' casual Hawaiian spot in San Bruno. I was sad to see their Hawaii-inspired brunch restaurant Morning Wood close because it had one of the best loco mocos I've ever had.The good news is that the Kaneshiros are back with an intimate Japanese restaurant
