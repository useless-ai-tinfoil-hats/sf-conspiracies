Dungeness crab season is finally opening in the Bay Area
-----
The local commercial Dungeness crab season is opening at long last â€” though not yet at full capacity.The California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced Thursday that fishermen can go out for crab between the Sonoma/Mendocino county line and the U.S./Mexico border starting Thursday, Jan. 18, but under a 50% trap reduction. The state said this is a "balanced approach" that reduces the risk of humpback whales getting tangled in traps while opening the much-delayed crab season
