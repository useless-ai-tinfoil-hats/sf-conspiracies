East Bay leaders launch new task force intended to combat crime
-----
A group of East Bay officials representing Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda County announced the formation of a public-safety partnership Wednesday in what they said was an effort to combat crime and improve public safety across the region."Perpetrators of crime aren't constrained by jurisdictional boundaries, and that means we have to work together across city and county lines to enhance public safety for the entire East Bay," Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu√≠n said in a statement.
