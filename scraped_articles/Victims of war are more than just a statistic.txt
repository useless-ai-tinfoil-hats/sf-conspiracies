Victims of war are more than just a statistic
-----
If someone had asked the students at my Monterey high school which one of us would be the first to go to Iraq, everyone would have probably said me. After all, my parents were the ones who emigrated from Iraq in the 1970s to escape Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship. We were just waiting for a safer time to visit our relatives and make pilgrimages to Iraq's many shrines.But Kylan Jones-Huffman, a student I ran track with, ended up being the first. He would lose his life there in August
