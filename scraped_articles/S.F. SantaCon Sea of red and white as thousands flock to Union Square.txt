S.F. SantaCon: Sea of red and white as thousands flock to Union Square
-----
People in red and white flooded Union Square on Saturday to kick off San Francisco's annual SantaCon, an event that draws thousands for a Christmas-themed toy drive and subsequent pub crawl.The event, infamous for ending in rowdy Santas packing bars, drew people of all ages — and dressed in varying degrees of Santa attire — to Union Square, where the festivities began and where the Santas could drop off their toys for the San Francisco Fire Department's toy drive.
Music, laughter
