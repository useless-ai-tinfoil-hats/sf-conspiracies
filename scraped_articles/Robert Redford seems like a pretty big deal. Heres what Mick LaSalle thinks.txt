Robert Redford seems like a pretty big deal. Here's what Mick LaSalle thinks
-----
Dear Mick: What are your thoughts on the diverse career and numerous accomplishments of Robert Redford?Robert Chapin, Monterey
Dear Robert: Redford is the most artistically consequential figure in American film in the second half of the 20th century. Period. (Sound of microphone dropping.)
Dear Mick: We agree that the academy often whiffs on best picture. Our most hated example of this is "Unforgiven" and not "The Last of the Mohicans." Wondering if you agree.
