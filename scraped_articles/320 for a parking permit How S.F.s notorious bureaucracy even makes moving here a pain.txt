$320 for a parking permit? How S.F.â€™s notorious bureaucracy even makes moving here a pain
-----
My first run-in with San Francisco's infamous bureaucracy happened before I even arrived here.About a week before my move from Sacramento to San Francisco, I realized that I might need a temporary permit to park and unload my moving van in front of my new building. I assumed, naively, that this would be a relatively easy and inexpensive process.
I was wrong.
After Googling around for a bit, I ended up on the Temporary Signage page of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation
