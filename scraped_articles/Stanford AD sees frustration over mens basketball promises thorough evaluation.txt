Stanford AD sees frustration over men’s basketball, promises ‘thorough evaluation’
-----
Stanford carried a six-game losing streak into its regular-season finale against visiting Cal on Thursday night, and it's certainly conceivable that the matchup against the Bears will be Jerod Haase's final game at Maples Pavilion as the Cardinal's head coach.Haase is ending his eighth season leading the program and unless Stanford (12-17, 7-12) wins four games in next week's Pac-12 tournament, the Cardinal will remain without an NCAA Tournament appearance in his tenure.
