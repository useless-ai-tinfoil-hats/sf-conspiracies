Historical photos from when the 49ers played in the heart of San Francisco
-----
Is there any NFL team that historically has had better local B-roll footage than the 49ers?Say what you want about the current state of San Francisco, but the Bay Area really has a plethora of options for TV networks to transition through fourth quarter timeouts during a home game: aerial shots of the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars down Hyde Street, Coit Tower at sunset. It's a field day of gorgeous landscapes, even if they're sorely mismatched to where the team actually plays.
