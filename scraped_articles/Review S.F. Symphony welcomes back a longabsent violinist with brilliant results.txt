Review: S.F. Symphony welcomes back a long-absent violinist, with brilliant results
-----
It has been a solid decade since the superb German violinist Julia Fischer last plied her trade in Davies Symphony Hall. That's a long time for San Francisco Symphony audiences to go without her distinctive brand of steely brilliance.But there she was again on Friday, Feb. 23, joining the orchestra and Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen for a sleek, aerodynamic account of Brahms' Violin Concerto that conjured up memories of her finest artistry.
It was a welcome return.
Fischer
