History, hierarchy and horse-trading: How Giants get their jersey numbers
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. â€” A locker has been prepared in the San Francisco Giants' clubhouse for Gold Glove third baseman Matt Chapman with his familiar No. 26 emblazoned on his new black and orange jersey.That meant Blake Sabol no longer was the proprietor of No. 26 and had to switch to another number. Which was nothing new for the utilityman.
"I'll be rocking 61," Sabol said, "and if it has a lot of hits in it, I'll keep it."
Sabol arrived at camp wearing No. 2 only to shift to 26
