California Supreme Court agrees to consider pulling tax measure from 2024 ballot
-----
In a rare action, the state Supreme Court granted a hearing Wednesday on a request by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators to remove an initiative from the November 2024 state ballot that would require voter approval for any increase in state or local taxes or fees.The justices denied their request to immediately cancel the vote on the ballot measure, but told its sponsors and state election officials to "show cause before this court" why the measure should go before the voters.
