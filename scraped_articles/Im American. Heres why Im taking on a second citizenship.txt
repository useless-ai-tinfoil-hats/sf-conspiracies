I’m American. Here’s why I’m taking on a second citizenship
-----
When I heard that I was about to become a Slovak citizen, I wondered what my grandpa Mark, dead for 30 years, might have said on hearing the news."What'd you do that for?" he might say, and we'd laugh about it. I heard from a family member that my grandfather said he never wanted to return to the place of his birth. Can I blame him? Shortly after he and his family left, a collaborationist Slovak government worked with the Nazis to deport 70,000 Slovak Jews to Polish concentration camps.
