Yes, Warriors’ Steve Kerr once agreed with Trump. That same issue is why he’s endorsing Biden
-----
Remember that crazy moment in time when Steve Kerr and Donald Trump were allies, singing the same tune, figuratively harmonizing like Simon & Garfunkel?Kerr remembers that moment, and that's why he is publicly endorsing Joe Biden for re-election.
The Golden State Warriors head coach made his endorsement official recently, in a joint Zoom appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris. Then Kerr appeared on MSNBC's "The 11th Hour With Stephanie Ruhle" to restate his support for Biden.
