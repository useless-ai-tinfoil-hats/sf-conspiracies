Sharks’ optimism might not last long; Logan Couture week-to-week in camp
-----
The first day of training camp usually comes with a sense of optimism. For the San Jose Sharks, that feeling shouldn't be expected to last — at least not in terms of wins and losses this season.An hour into Day 1, they announced captain Logan Couture is week-to-week. They already were missing Norris-winning defenseman Erik Karlsson and top goal-scorer Timo Meier — both of whom were traded — and expectations might be as low as they've ever been in the 32-year history of the franchise.
