Levi's Stadium seats could be packed with Cowboys fans for 49ersâ€™ game
-----
Here come the Dallas Cowboys. And their fans."America's Team" won't lack support in Santa Clara on Sunday night when they visit the San Francisco 49ers. At least that will be the case according to Vivid Seats, an online ticket exchange and resale broker which estimates that 36% of the crowd at 68,500-seat Levi's Stadium will be Cowboys fans.
In other words, it wouldn't be a road-game takeover on par with the sea of red that's created when the 49ers have visited the Rams at SoFi
