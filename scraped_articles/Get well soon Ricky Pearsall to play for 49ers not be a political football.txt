Get well soon Ricky Pearsall, to play for 49ers, not be a political football
-----
As Ricky Pearsall recovers from a bullet wound, the young man who just wants to suit up and catch passes for the San Francisco 49ers finds himself a political football.The hope here is that the rookie wide receiver is able to ignore the outside noise and heal in peace. My wish is that he kicks back and lets the rest of us fight and squabble about the deeper meaning of the failed robbery attempt that sent Pearsall and his assailant to the hospital Saturday afternoon with bullet wounds.
