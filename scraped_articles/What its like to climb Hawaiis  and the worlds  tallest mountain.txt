What it's like to climb Hawaii's – and the world's – tallest mountain
-----
We're about 2,000 feet shy of the 13,800-foot peak of Hawaii's Maunakea volcano, the world's tallest mountain, when my hiking partner Ashley starts to lose it.A watering tube hangs from her exhausted, pursed lips. Shrouded in a hooded raincoat, yoga pants, and sunglasses, she's barely recognizable and reminds me of "Dune's" Fremen, whose tight "stillsuits" protect their bodies and moisture from a harsh desert world.
The scenery encourages the comparison. Beyond Ashley and the trail
