Longtime Bay Area sports writer says The Athletic is censoring column
-----
The Athletic is apparently telling Bay Area sports columnist Tim Kawakami that he can't address certain questions in his mailbag columns.Kawakami was critical of San Jose Sharks owner Hasso Plattner in his latest mailbag column on Wednesday, which led two people to disagree with Kawakami in the column's comment section. Kawakami elected to respond to those comments in a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter. In doing so, Kawakami said he's been told he can't comment on company matters
