Bay Area band Business Casual celebrates the weirdness of 'Last BART'
-----
BART rides can be surreal, especially the last BART of the night. Late-shift commuters share coaches with stragglers from bars. Some riders put on headphones; others blare music from speakers.

The last BART is simultaneously loud and quiet, tired and wired.To Oakland band Business Casual, the oddness of the last BART is charming. Charming enough that the band wrote
