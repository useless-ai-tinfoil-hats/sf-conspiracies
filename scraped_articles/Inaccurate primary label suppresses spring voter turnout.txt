Inaccurate ‘primary’ label suppresses spring voter turnout
-----
My fellow Californians, your government is lying to you. Without conscience or remorse. About our elections.The lie isn't new. It is 14 years old. And it's a bipartisan falsehood — parroted by both political parties and defended by media across the spectrum — including, perhaps, the publication where you are reading this column.
The lie is not hidden. The state publishes it the voter guides and ballots it sends you.
What is this lie?
It's that the spring state elections
