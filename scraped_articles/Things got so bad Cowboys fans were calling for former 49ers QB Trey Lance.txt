Things got so bad, Cowboys fans were calling for former 49ers QB Trey Lance
-----
Things got so bad for the second-seeded Cowboys in their blowout home loss to the seventh-seeded Packers that fans were calling for former 49ers quarterback over Trey Lance to replace Dak Prescott.Yeah, the same Trey Lance who didn't win the back-up quarterback job in San Francisco or the back-up quarterback job in Dallas after the Niners traded him for a fourth round pick.
Cowboys superfan/Fox Sports hot take artist Skip Bayless made the call with Dallas down 34-10 with 3:50 to go
