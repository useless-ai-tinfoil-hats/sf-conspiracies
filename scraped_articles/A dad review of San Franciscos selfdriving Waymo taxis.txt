I was raised to fear the machines. I fear sentient robots turning against me or, even worse, taking my job. I fear artificial intelligence becoming so advanced that it decides the world would be better off without mankind existing, which is probably true but is also offensive to pro-human folks such as myself. I fear AI bots creating a deepfake video of me going on a dog hunt with Kristi Noem and then disseminating that video out to the public. And I fear that Big Tech knows who I'd like to see
