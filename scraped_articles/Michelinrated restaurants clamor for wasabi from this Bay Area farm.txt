Michelin-rated restaurants clamor for wasabi from this Bay Area farm
-----
Inside a bright greenhouse, a sea of leafy greens stretched as far as the eye can see, Jeff Roller methodically scans hundreds of wasabi plants organized in long rows. After nearly two years, the rare wasabi plants are ready for harvest and will soon be served alongside dishes at some of the Bay Area's buzziest restaurants."The whole plant is edible," Roller says as he gently tugs a plant up from the ground. "We sell the leaves with the stem as a separate product to restaurants."
