Pickleball injuries are spiking â€” but is the sport more likely to cause harm?
-----
Ron Friedman remembers the exact moment he hurt his right knee."It was in the middle of a pickleball rally, and I aggressively moved toward the ball and made a sort of twisting movement and I felt it right then," Friedman said of the match in February at Palo Alto's Mitchell Park. "It happened in an instant."
Worried he might have re-injured his meniscus, which he'd previously torn while playing pickleball a few years prior, Friedman, 74, made an appointment to see his doctor.
