Aidan Mahaney scores 25 points as St. Maryâ€™s rolls over New Mexico
-----
First impressions about this St. Mary's team, based off the Gaels' second game of the season, a 72-58 blowout of New Mexico in Moraga on Thursday night:One, Randy Bennett's team still knows how to play defense. And two, guard Aidan Mahaney might know how to score even more effectively than he did last season as a freshman when he averaged 13.9 points per game and was a first-team All-WCC selection.
The Campolindo-Moraga alum poured in a game-high 25 points, tying his career high.
