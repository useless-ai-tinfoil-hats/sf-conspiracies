Bay Area storms bring flooding, mudslides and crawling commutes
-----
A formidable winter storm flexed its muscles over the Bay Area on Wednesday, pelting the region with rain and wind, snarling traffic and producing localized flooding.For those who like the pitter-patter of rain, hot cocoa and a good book on a wintry day, it was ideal.
For those traveling by plane, train or automobile, it was suboptimal.
Nearly an inch of rain fell on San Francisco from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, with similar amounts in surrounding areas.
