Former Bay Area news anchor Frank Somerville will face 30 days in jail after admitting to a probation violation and pleading no contest to alcohol-related reckless driving â€” the final resolution of two chaotic altercations with family members last year.An Alameda County Superior Court judge on Monday approved the plea deal, which sought to settle stark discrepancies between what Somerville and his brother told law enforcement, after coming to blows in their father's Berkeley hills home.
