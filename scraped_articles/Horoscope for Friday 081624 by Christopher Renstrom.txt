ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Think before you speak because what sounds witty in the moment could wind up costing later.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Drawing a line in the sand now will only defeat your purpose. Wait until the 27th when the winds of change are at your back.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You may not agree with the criticism, but incorporate it into a project or proposal. This wins detractors over to your side.
CANCER (June 20 - July 21): Don't go with your first
