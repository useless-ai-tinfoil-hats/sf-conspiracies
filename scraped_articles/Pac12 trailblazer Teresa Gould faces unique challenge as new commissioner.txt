Pac-12 trailblazer Teresa Gould faces unique challenge as new commissioner

Teresa Gould grew up in Burlington, Iowa, more than willing to climb into the arena.She fought to establish a softball team, so she didn't have to play baseball with the boys. She fought for open gym time, so she and other girls basketball players could work on their games like their male counterparts did.
Fast forward to 2024 and now Gould is engaged in another type of sporting battle.
She becomes Pac-12 commissioner on Friday, replacing George Kliavkoff in a landmark moment
