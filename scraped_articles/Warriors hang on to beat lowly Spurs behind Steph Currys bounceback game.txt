Warriors hang on to beat lowly Spurs behind Steph Curry’s bounce-back game
-----
First concern, then relief.Against the worst team in the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors looked mostly lost in the first half and trailed by as many as 10 points. A 15-2 run to begin the fourth quarter, though, allowed the Warriors to pull away before surviving a late Spurs comeback bid to win 118-112 at Chase Center on Saturday.
Stephen Curry bounced back from his worst shooting game of the season with 35 points — 23 in the second half — going 7-for-14 from 3-point
