Neal Sofman, legend of Bay Area independent booksellers, dies at 75
-----
To open a small neighborhood bookstore in the age of Amazon takes tremendous optimism, and Neal Sofman should have known better.He opened Bookshop West Portal even as he was closing A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books in Opera Plaza in 2006.
This time, to make it in a struggling shopping strip west of Twin Peaks, Sofman was counting on providing a personal touch that no longer seemed to appeal to busy shoppers on Van Ness Avenue in Civic Center.
He was right. Bookshop West
