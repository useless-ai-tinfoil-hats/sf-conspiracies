Her art is all over Bay Area restaurants. But her masterpiece is her mom’s Tenderloin cafe
-----
Make the rounds of professionally cool restaurants, bars and cafes in the Bay Area and you will soon encounter the work of sign painter Michelle "Meng" Nguyễn. The silhouette of a lanky, gilded martini glass on the door of Oakland's Friends and Family is hers, as is the flowing cursive leading into the blocky PIZZA on the windows of Outta Sight in the Tenderloin. Her lettering can be understated and precise (Rosalind Bakery in Pacifica) or exuberant and bubbly (Mother in the Mission District).
