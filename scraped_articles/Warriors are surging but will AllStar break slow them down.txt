Warriors are surging, but will All-Star break slow them down?
-----
Their bodies might welcome the rest, but the Golden State Warriors probably aren't thrilled with the timing of this year's All-Star break.The Warriors have won seven of their past nine games, even after squandering a 15-point lead in Wednesday night's 130-125 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. This surge has pushed Golden State (26-26) into 10th place in the Western Conference standings, two games behind the ninth-place Lakers and 1Â½ ahead of No. 11 Utah, entering Thursday's games.
