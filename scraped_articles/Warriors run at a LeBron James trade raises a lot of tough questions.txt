Warriorsâ€™ run at a LeBron James trade raises a lot of tough questions
-----
The Golden State Warriors' season got more interesting Wednesday, with the news that they tried to lure LeBron James away from the Los Angeles Lakers.According to an ESPN report, Warriors owner Joe Lacob called his Lakers counterpart, Jeanie Buss, before last Thursday's trade deadline inquiring about whether the team and James would be open to a trade, amid his public frustrations over Los Angeles' struggles. Lacob also reached out to James' agent, as did Warriors forward Draymond Green.
