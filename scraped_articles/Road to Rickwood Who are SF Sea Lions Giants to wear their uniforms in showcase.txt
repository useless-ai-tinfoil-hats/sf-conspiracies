Road to Rickwood: Who are SF Sea Lions? Giants to wear their uniforms in showcase
-----
John Walton was a pitcher on the 1946 San Francisco Sea Lions, who played in a one-of-a-kind Negro League on the West Coast."I know that he had movement," said his son, Billy Walton, 70, a Lafayette resident, "because when I was a kid and my mom told my dad to play catch with me, I saw how he could make that ball move down to the right, down to the left â€” oh, man, I didn't have to move my glove. He had a lot of movement on the ball, but placement was the main thing for him."
