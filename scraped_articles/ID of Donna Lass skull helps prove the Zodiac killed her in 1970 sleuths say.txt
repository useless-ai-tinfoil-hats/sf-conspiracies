ID of Donna Lass skull helps prove the Zodiac killed her in 1970, sleuths say
-----
The Zodiac Killer murdered South Lake Tahoe nurse Donna Lass in 1970, amateur sleuths have long contended, and now they say the long-delayed identification last week of her skull helps prove their case.The skull was found in 1986 near Emigrant Gap, high in the Sierra Nevada along Highway 20 â€” but cold-case detectives in Placer County didn't connect the skull to the missing woman until they recently sent DNA samples to a state lab and got a match with her relatives.
