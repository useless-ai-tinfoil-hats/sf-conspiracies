The Warriors are reportedly willing to blow it all up with Steph Curry as the lone survivor
-----
The Warriors were apparently just another tough loss away from dramatically shifting their philosophy at the trade deadline.The Athletic's Shams Charania reported Thursday that Golden State is a lot more willing to move anyone on the team not named Steph Curry in the wake of a second straight blowout defeat, a 141-105 loss to the Pelicans.
"The mindset in Golden State right now is everyone but Steph Curry is on the table," Charania said on "Run It Back," an online sports show.
