S.F.â€™s de Young Museum promises changes after man dies of heart attack nearby
-----
San Francisco's de Young Museum is rebutting claims that its staff refused Sunday to lend its defibrillator to people seeking to help a man who collapsed nearby of an apparent heart attack, and added that it is making improvements in reaction to the incident.Museum spokesperson Helena Nordstrom said in an email to the Chronicle that the museum determined that an ambulance had already arrived to attend to Gary Hobish, who was lying unconscious, and so the defibrillator was not needed.
