With Warriorsâ€™ season at stake, what if Draymond Green is the fix they need?
-----
The Golden State Warriors need a spark. They need an infusion, a transfusion, an inspiration.What if what they need is Draymond Green?
What if Green is the only logical solution to the Warriors' current situation, which is that they are floating in the doldrums?
Crazy thought, right? The last thing the Warriors seem to need right now is an over-the-hill, self-absorbed, ref-baiting hothead to return and take away valuable minutes from players who deserve to be on the floor.
