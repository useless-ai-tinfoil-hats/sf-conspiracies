Warriorsâ€™ long homestand includes string of stout opponents
-----
The Golden State Warriors are in the early stages of their longest homestand of the season, seven consecutive games at Chase Center. But this rare stretch comes with a caveat: They're playing really good teams.Thursday night's 114-102 loss to Miami opened the homestand, as the Heat improved to 19-12 by smothering the Warriors. Saturday's game against Dallas (18-14) marked the second of four consecutive games against opponents with a winning record.
Golden State then plays Orlando
