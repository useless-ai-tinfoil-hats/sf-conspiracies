ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Still smarting over a recent confrontation? Your moment of weakness actually came across as a show of strength as you'll see for yourself today.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You've been avoiding an unflattering truth, but today's Moon/Saturn trine shows that you're in the right headspace to handle it.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Respond to a compromise with a compromise. There can be no true victor, but you'll both benefit from working together.
