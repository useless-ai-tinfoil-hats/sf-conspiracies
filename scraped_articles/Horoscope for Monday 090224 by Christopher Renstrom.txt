Horoscope for Monday, 09/02/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Sometimes the only way to know if you're capable is to dive in at the deep end. As a child of Mars, you'll find the plunge exhilarating.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Realization dawns when you see how your feelings have changed and the other person's haven't. It's best to slip out the back while you can.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): It's been a crazy 6 months, but you have to admit you're better off now than you were before. Celebrate before the Stars
