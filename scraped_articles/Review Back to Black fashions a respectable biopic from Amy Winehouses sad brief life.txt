Review: ‘Back to Black’ fashions a respectable biopic from Amy Winehouse’s sad, brief life
-----
The Amy Winehouse biopic, "Back to Black," has only one problem, and that's Winehouse herself.The English singer-songwriter had a unique talent but a very generic addiction to drugs and alcohol, and alas, what was wonderful and original about her was eventually subsumed by what was typical about her. Stuck with that story, the filmmakers could only do what they could do, and so, in "Back to Black," we end up with a lovely and unexpected first half followed by an inexorable second half.
