Why two jets flew over San Francisco on Friday afternoon
-----
When two jets flew over San Francisco on Friday afternoon, many hopped on social media to comment on the load roar heard across the city."Seriously, WTF: fighter jets over San Francisco?!?" the Mr. San Francisco account on X (formerly Twitter) posted.
Another X user commented that they were so loud they "set off car alarms."
Another person on X pointed out that it's not Fleet Week, the fall event when the Blue Angels and other military aircraft buzz over the city for days.
