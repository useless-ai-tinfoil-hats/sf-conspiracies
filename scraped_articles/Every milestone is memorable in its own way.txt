Every milestone is memorable in its own way

We think of participation trophies as a millennial idea, but there was a mention of them as far back as Feb. 8, 1922, in the Evening Independent newspaper in Massillon, Ohio. The story, about a high school basketball tournament in Ohio, noted "trophies galore will be handed out."The practice of rewarding participants spread to things like peewee football and even the U.S. military in World War II. There are critics who call such awards part of the "diapering" of America, but not me.
