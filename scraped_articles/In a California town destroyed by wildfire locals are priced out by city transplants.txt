In a California town destroyed by wildfire, locals are priced out by city transplants
-----
On Nov. 8, 2018, Rebecca Settergren was two weeks away from owning the house she'd rented for over 20 years. Her landlord had offered to put the property in her name without a down payment and planned to drive up to the small, forested town of Paradise later that month to sign the papers.But when Settergren woke up that morning, the sky was red.
"I went outside to see what the hell was going on, and live embers and burning pieces of wood were pelting my house like rain," she said.
