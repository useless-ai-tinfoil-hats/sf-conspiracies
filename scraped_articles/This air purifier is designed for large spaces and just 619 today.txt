Not all air purifiers are created equal, and not all rooms have the same air purification needs. Small spaces can easily get by with a portable purifier, but large, expansive rooms need something, well, a little more powerful. Coway's Airmega ProX is suitable for those oversized spots and can refresh the air in a 4,253 square foot space every 60 minutes, the air in a 2,126 square foot space every 30 minutes, and the air in a 1,063 square foot space every 15 minutes. It's marked down to $619 on
