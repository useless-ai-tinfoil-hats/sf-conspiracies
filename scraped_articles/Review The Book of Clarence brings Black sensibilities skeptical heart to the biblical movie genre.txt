Review: ‘The Book of Clarence’ brings Black sensibilities, skeptical heart to the biblical movie genre
-----
After his winning 2021 reimagining of the Western "The Harder They Fall" for his second feature, British filmmaker Jeymes Samuel applies that go-for-broke entertainer's sensibility to the Christ story in "The Book of Clarence." It's a wildly ambitious effort — equal parts satire, modern Black take on the Holy Land of 2,000 years ago, serious dialectic between belief and knowledge — that plays out rather shaggy. But Lord is it fun, in a way church and Hollywood's biblical epics almost never are.
