One of the country’s star chefs is now cooking at this Bay Area bar
-----
A James Beard Award-nominated chef from Michelin-starred San Francisco restaurant State Bird Provisions is now running the kitchen at an acclaimed Bay Area bar.It's an exciting development for Friends and Family at 468 25th St. in Oakland, which was on the verge of ditching its full food menu — until chef Gaby Maeda entered the picture.
As Friends and Family's former chef was getting ready to leave in December, owner Blake Cole considered scrapping all but the most minimal dishes.
