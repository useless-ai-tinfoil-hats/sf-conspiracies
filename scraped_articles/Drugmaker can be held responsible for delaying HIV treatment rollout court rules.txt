Drugmaker can be held responsible for delaying HIV treatment rollout, court rules
-----
In a suit by 24,000 AIDS patients, a state appeals court says pharmaceutical giant Gilead Life Sciences can be held responsible for delaying release of a drug for years while it marketed another product that it knew had potentially harmful side effects.Even though the drug it continued selling for nearly a decade was effective against AIDS and the HIV virus, the company can be held to account "if the reason was solely to maximize Gilead's profits," said the 1st District Court of Appeal
