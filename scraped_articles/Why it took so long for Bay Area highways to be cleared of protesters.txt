Why it took so long for Bay Area highways to be cleared of protesters
-----
Protesters stopped traffic for hours on major highways during rush hour in the San Francisco Bay Area on Monday morning, as part of a global campaign to obstruct key economic routes in cities and push world leaders for a ceasefire in Gaza.In peaceful but highly disruptive demonstrations, they blocked a section of northbound Interstate 880 in Oakland for seven hours and a portion of southbound 880 and the Golden Gate Bridge for about four hours, the California Highway Patrol said.
