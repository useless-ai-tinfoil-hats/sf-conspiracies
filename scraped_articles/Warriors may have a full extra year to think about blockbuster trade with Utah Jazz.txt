Warriors may have a full extra year to think about blockbuster trade with Utah Jazz
-----
It looks like a possible Warriors blockbuster trade for Utah Jazz star Lauri Markkanen will be on hold until after this season.Three independent reports published Monday reveal that Markkanen is not expected to sign a contract extension with the Jazz by Tuesday, the first day he's eligible for his big payday. The Utah big man is in the final year of his current deal, but he can sign a four-year, $232 million extension that, as ESPN notes, only the Jazz can realistically offer.
