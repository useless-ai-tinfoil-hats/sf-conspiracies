UC regents delay controversial plan to limit political speech on university websites
-----
The University of California regents on Wednesday postponed a vote on whether to bar professors and staff from posting their personal views on prominent campus web pages â€” a concession to faculty leaders who argued that the proposal limiting their speech was still half-baked.It was the second time this year that the regents kicked the vote down the road. On the first day of a two-day meeting at UCLA, they unanimously agreed to take up the matter again in May and refine it in the interim.
