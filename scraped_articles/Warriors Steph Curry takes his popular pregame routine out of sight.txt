Warriors' Steph Curry takes his popular pregame routine out of sight

PORTLAND, Ore. — Several Golden State Warriors fans in No. 30 jerseys stood near the Moda Center baseline about 75 minutes before tipoff Sunday evening, waiting for Stephen Curry to emerge from the tunnel for his famous pregame routine.There was just one problem: Curry was already back in the visitors' locker room. For the second night in a row, he had gone through his routine about two hours before tipoff — 45 minutes ahead of his usual slot time.
It might seem like a minor
