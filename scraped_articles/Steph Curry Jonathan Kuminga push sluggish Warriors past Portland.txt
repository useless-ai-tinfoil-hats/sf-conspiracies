Steph Curry, Jonathan Kuminga push sluggish Warriors past Portland

Jonathan Kuminga began Wednesday night's game as an afterthought. He planted himself near the end of the Golden State Warriors' bench and stayed there through the first quarter … and the second quarter … and the first seven-plus minutes of the third quarter.Finally, as his team struggled to find any traction against a young, uber-athletic Portland team, head coach Steve Kerr turned to his young, uber-athletic wild card. Kerr sent Kuminga into the game, and suddenly the dynamic changed.
