Horoscope for Thursday, 04/04/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Follow that hunch. Something inside's telling you to give it a go and it could make all the difference.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): That sure bet just got a little risky. Rather than cross your fingers and hope for the best, you might backpedal until things are more secure.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Usually you're willing to accommodate people's schedules, but with all the hemming and hawing that's going on you may want to stick to what was agreed at
