This trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco takes 38 hours, but it's worth it
-----
I've grown tired of slapping myself repeatedly to stay awake as I drive on the monotonous Interstate 5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco.With just weeks before I said goodbye to California for a new job out of state, I decided to reinvent how to travel the busy corridor by embarking on a 13-ride, 38-hour journey between the two cities â€” using only municipal and regional buses or trains.
The journey started at 7:13 a.m. on Thursday in Los Angeles' Union Station and ended at 8:59
