Aâ€™s honor Miguel Cabrera, then lose for the 107th time this season
-----
Miguel Cabrera is gracing the Coliseum for the last time in his illustrious 21-year career, and it was cool for the announced crowd of 6,160 to watch him take some final hacks Thursday night.In between "Sell the team" chants.
Cabrera went 0-for-3 with a strikeout as Detroit's designated hitter, but it didn't matter for the home team because the Oakland Athletics lost yet again, falling 7-3 to extend their latest losing streak to eight games.
Not only have the A's lost eight
