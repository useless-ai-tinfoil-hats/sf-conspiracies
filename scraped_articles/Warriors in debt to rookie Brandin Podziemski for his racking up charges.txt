Warriors in debt to rookie Brandin Podziemski for his racking up charges
-----
If the late, great John Madden were still around and decided to branch out and pick an All-Madden Team for the NBA, Brandin Podziemski of the Golden State Warriors would be on it.Madden once defined All-Madden thusly: "It's about a guy who's got a dirty uniform, mud on his face, and grass in the ear hole of his helmet."
The Warriors' rookie guard doesn't wear a helmet, though he should. One of the things he does well — his signature move, you might say — is taking charges.
