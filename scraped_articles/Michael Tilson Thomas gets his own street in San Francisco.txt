Michael Tilson Thomas gets his own street in San Francisco
-----
Politicians almost never fully agree about anything, but the entire San Francisco Board of Supervisors is evidently of one mind when it comes to Michael Tilson Thomas.Following a unanimous board vote last month, the block of Grove Street between Franklin Street and Van Ness Avenue has officially been renamed MTT Way in honor of the San Francisco Symphony's music director laureate, who served as the orchestra's music director for an unprecedented 25 years before stepping down in 2020.
