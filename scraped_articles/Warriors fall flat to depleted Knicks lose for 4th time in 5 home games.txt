Warriors fall flat to depleted Knicks, lose for 4th time in 5 home games
-----
If Steve Kerr or Stephen Curry had solutions to the Golden State Warriors' woes at home, they certainly would have administered them by now.Or well before they left the court Monday with a losing home record with six games at Chase Center left in the regular season, and 15 remaining overall.
Said Curry from the bowels of Chase Center, where the Warriors endured their third straight home defeat: "It's a challenge we have to overcome at some point down the stretch of the season."
