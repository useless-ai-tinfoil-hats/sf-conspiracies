49ers' Brock Purdy gets away from it all by harvesting Iowa corn during bye week
-----
After a rough three weeks, 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy is using his bye week to get away from it all.Of course, that doesn't mean he's getting away from a hard day's work.
Jenna Brandt, Purdy's fianc√©e, posted a seven-second clip on her Instagram Story of the 23-year-old working her family's farm in Iowa. After scanning a field of corn, the camera pans to Purdy, who is operating a combine harvester while wearing a white 49ers hat. The post is captioned "Wrapping up harvest '23"
