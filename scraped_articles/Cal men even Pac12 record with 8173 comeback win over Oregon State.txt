Cal men even Pac-12 record with 81-73 comeback win over Oregon State
-----
Of the many ways to chronicle how Mark Madsen has turned around a Cal basketball program that went 3-29 last season and has endured six straight losing seasons, this ranks with the most illuminating:After the Bears pulled out an 81-73 victory over Oregon State at Haas Pavilion on Thursday night, they improved to 8-8 in Pac-12 play. The eight conference wins are one more than they managed in the previous two seasons combined â€” and Cal has four Pac-12 games remaining.
