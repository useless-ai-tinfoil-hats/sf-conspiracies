Warriorsâ€™ Gary Payton II has more fun than anyone (except maybe Steph Curry)
-----
Gary Payton II is the Golden State Warriors' Puck.I don't know diddly about Shakespeare, but the name Puck popped into my head, so I Googled it. Puck is a character in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," his name now synonymous with a mischievous sprite or jokester.
That seemed to fit Payton, especially this note on Puck: "He significantly influences events in the play."
Head coach Steve Kerr doesn't roll out a 6-foot-3 power forward for 17 minutes every game just to keep things
