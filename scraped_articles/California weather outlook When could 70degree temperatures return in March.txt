California weather outlook: When could 70-degree temperatures return in March?
-----
The age-old proverb about March weather, "In like a lion, out like a lamb," might apply perfectly to California this month.March kicked off with a blizzard that dropped more than 10 feet of snow in parts of the Sierra Nevada, and well below-normal temperatures to Northern and Central California. The wet weather pattern is expected to continue for the next week or so, particularly from the Bay Area to the Oregon border, but there are signs of change in the extended forecast.
