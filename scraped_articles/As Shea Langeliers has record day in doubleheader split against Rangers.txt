A’s Shea Langeliers has record day in doubleheader split against Rangers
-----
Shea Langeliers' performance in the Oakland Athletics' split of a doubleheader against Texas at the Coliseum on Wednesday linked him with Mickey Cochrane and Herman Franks and enabled Langeliers to supplant Reggie Jackson in the Oakland record book.That's a pretty darn good 18 innings — not to mention five hours and 52 minutes — of baseball.
Langeliers hit a double, triple and homer and drove in a career-high five runs in the opener, which the A's won 9-4 with Langeliers catching.
