Calif. rains make LA's most popular waterfall hike a sight to behold
-----
Just a few steps into my hike, I already felt peaceful. I could hear the sound of a rushing stream, birds were chirping, flowers were blooming, and the landscape was shrouded in greenery, always a welcome sight for Angelenos used to seeing dry brown brush during our driest and hottest periods.And I hadn't even made it to the waterfall yet.
Pasadena's Eaton Canyon is one of the most popular hikes in the Los Angeles area, and for good reason. It's one of the closest waterfall hikes
