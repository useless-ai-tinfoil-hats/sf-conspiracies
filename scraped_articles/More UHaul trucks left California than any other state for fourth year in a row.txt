More U-Haul trucks left California than any other state for fourth year in a row
-----
More U-Haul trucks departed from California for the fourth consecutive year than any other state, new data from the moving truck rental company shows.California once again landed at No. 50 on the company's annual growth index report, meaning the state saw the most net loss from one-way U-Haul rentals in the country. The company's growth index is calculated using the net gain of trucks that arrive in a state versus the number of trucks that depart.
