A wrenching tribute to Dejan Milojevic before Warriors return to the court
-----
The lasting image from Golden State's 134-112 win over the Hawks on Wednesday night came moments before tip-off. There, on the Chase Center Jumbotron, were late Warriors assistant coach Dejan Milojevic's wife, Natasa, and two children, Nikola and Masa.As tears streamed down Natasa's face, Nikola (age 20) and Masa (14) tried to comfort their mother. The scene lasted only a couple of seconds. But in that instance, a capacity crowd of 18,064 was able to peer into one family's heartbreak.
