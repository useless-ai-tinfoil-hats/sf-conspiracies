Why starting this S.F. wine bar was ‘as tough as opening a strip club’
-----
Opening a restaurant in San Francisco's Mission District, one local business owner recently claimed, is as difficult as opening a strip club.Naz Khorram, who owns a wine bar called Arcana on Mission Street, made the widely shared remarks during a Sept. 7 Planning Commission discussion of proposed permitting changes. To open Arcana, Khorram needed the same kind of city authorization it takes to open hotels, mortuaries and adult businesses like porn shops and strip clubs in the Mission.
