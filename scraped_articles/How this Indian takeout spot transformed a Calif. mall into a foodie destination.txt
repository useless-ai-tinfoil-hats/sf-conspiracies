-----
It's not quite noon on a clear spring Friday in the Central Valley. Patrons are already forming a queue a half dozen deep, waiting to sample fare from one of the region's buzziest and most sought-after restaurants.But it's not a must-stop on Interstate 5, nor is it a sit-down joint in the heart of a historic downtown. The line stretches past more well-known food purveyors nearby, including Sbarro, Five Guys, Panda Express and Chipotle.
