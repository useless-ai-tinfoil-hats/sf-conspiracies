I remember growing up and always getting stuck with vacuuming the house as my weekly chore. Back then, we had to deal with bulky upright vacuums and all their inconvenient bags and cords. These days, vacuuming is easier than ever because we have robots that can handle the chore for us. Right now at Walmart, you can get the Shark AI Ultra Robot Vacuum for $298 (reg. $599) and add one of the brand's most popular models to your home.Shark AI Ultra Robot Vacuum - $298 ($301 off; originally
