New Giants pitcher Jordan Hicks explains desire to move to rotation
-----
New San Francisco Giants pitcher Jordan Hicks admitted Thursday that when he's on the mound, he regularly looks at the scoreboard to check his velocity readings."I want to know what I've got after the effort I put in," Hicks said shortly after his four-year, $44 million contract became official. "I'm not, like, staring at it. I would take a quick peek and get back to work."
This is a man who has thrown 105 mph, after all. Why wouldn't he want to check the radar gun? Not many others
