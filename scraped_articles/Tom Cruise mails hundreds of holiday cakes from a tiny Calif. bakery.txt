Tom Cruise mails hundreds of holiday cakes from a tiny Calif. bakery
-----
You may not know this, but Hollywood ultra A-lister Tom Cruise has a thing for cake. Every holiday season, the "Mission: Impossible" star sends out hundreds of coconut cakes to friends, fellow celebrities, and sometimes random people, usually with a small note attached. Tom Hanks and Kirsten Dunst have gotten them, and they swear the so-called "Tom Cruise cake" is the best they've ever had.What the heck is this cake, and where does it come from?
