14 Outside Lands-inspired diversions happening beyond the festival gates
-----
The Outside Lands music festival is expected once again to draw huge crowds in Golden Gate Park this weekend (Aug. 9-11). And with its heavy-hitting lineup featuring live music, street art, LGBTQ+ performances and more, it's no wonder. Extensive food and drink areas (with more than 100 restaurants, breweries, vintners and distillers represented), Grass Lands' onsite cannabis areas and a vending marketplace top off the massive event's offerings.There's also plenty to do beyond the gates.
