-----
A crowd of 50 Bay Area music fans sat in silence in the intimate Secret Alley event space in the Mission as the needle dropped on a vinyl record.The listening party, hosted by internet radio station BFF.FM and reissue record label Dark Entries, began with a delicate piano melody filling the air, followed by the voice of one of the most recognizable singers in San Francisco music history: Sylvester.
But he wasn't singing a classic disco cut like "You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)."
