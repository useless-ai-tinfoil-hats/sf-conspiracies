Your phone is about to screech again: California to test MyShake app with quake simulation
-----
Millions of Californians will get a test alert for an earthquake on October 19, via the MyShake app. The warning — which residents will be notified about beforehand — will go out at 10:19 a.m. to phones in Oregon and Washington as well as California.It's part of a broader annual drill called ShakeOut Day to simulate a major earthquake.
The drill — always on the third Thursday of October — encourages Californians to duck, cover and hold, as they would in a major earthquake.
