49ers' Deebo Samuel is still fighting a war of words with Cowboys' Micah Parsons
-----
49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel is apparently quite an efficient man, needing all of 45 seconds Wednesday to shut down two of the loudest critics of his quarterback Brock Purdy.In his weekly appearance on the "Up and Adams" YouTube show, Samuel defended Purdy's four-interception effort on Monday night against the Ravens.
Host Kay Adams brought up some of the criticism Purdy has faced, particularly from former NFL MVP Cam Newton and current Cowboys defensive end Micah Parsons.
