(April 20 - May 20): The best way to establish yourself is to shore up your position. Expanding too fast weakens resources whereas consolidation maximizes them.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): It's not a good idea to argue when opinions are so heated. Switch from debate to persuasion and you'll talk people
