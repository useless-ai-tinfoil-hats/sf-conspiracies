New York Times names Berkeley restaurant one of the best pizza places in US
-----
Berkeley has no shortage of critically acclaimed pizzerias, but one just received national attention. Rose Pizzeria, a restaurant on Berkeley's University Avenue known for its charming patio and dreamy thin-crust pies, was named one of the 22 best pizza places in the country by the New York Times on Tuesday."In a place where you can't swing a pie without hitting a fermentation-happy sourdough pizza joint, Rose stands apart," wrote New York Times editor Brian Gallagher.
