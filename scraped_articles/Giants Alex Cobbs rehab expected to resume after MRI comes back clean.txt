Giants’ Alex Cobb’s rehab expected to resume after MRI comes back clean
-----
The San Francisco Giants were concerned about pitcher Alex Cobb because he had developed what they called "mild shoulder inflammation" in his right arm, leading to a visit with a team doctor.But after Thursday's 5-0 win over Arizona, Cobb said in the Giants' clubhouse that he felt fine and that an MRI exam of the shoulder came back clean. He planned to throw on flat ground Friday.
"I was never really concerned about it," Cobb said. "I just wanted the doc to see it. Peace of mind."
