Giantsâ€™ home opener made it clear: Bob Melvin is managing in right place
-----
Boy, is Bob Melvin happy he's not managing the Oakland Athletics.No, he didn't say that. He would never say that. In the baseball industry, he's known as a gentleman who tends to take the high road. He won't bash his former team no matter how poorly it has been run during owner John Fisher's relocation process.
As the San Francisco Giants' manager, Melvin has a sweeter gig, of course. The Giants are talking about October playoffs. The A's are talking about November layoffs.
