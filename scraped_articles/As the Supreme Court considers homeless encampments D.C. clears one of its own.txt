As the Supreme Court considers homeless encampments, D.C. clears one of its own

WASHINGTON — In a city park, workers in hazmat suits were picking up the remains of someone's life — a purse, bedding and whatever else had been left behind. They moved efficiently through the homeless encampment, shoveling everything left behind into a trash bag or nearby garbage trucks.At 20th and E streets northwest in Washington, D.C., across from the State Department and Federal Reserve, residents of the encampment were still packing up.
Some had been offered a place to stay
