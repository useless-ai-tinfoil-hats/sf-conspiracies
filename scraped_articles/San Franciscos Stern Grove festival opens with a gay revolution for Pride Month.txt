San Francisco's Stern Grove festival opens with a 'gay revolution' for Pride Month
-----
Stern Grove Festival kicked off its 87th annual music festival this weekend with a sold-out Tegan and Sara show opened by queer pop-punk Oakland musician King Isis. Festival attendees clad in sweaters shed layers as they made their way to an idyllic amphitheater lawn, rendered nearly invisible by seas of picnic blankets and bobbing heads."We are celebrating people; we are celebrating love, we are celebrating us," Tegan Quin said to the crowd.
For Pride Month, fans arrived in droves
