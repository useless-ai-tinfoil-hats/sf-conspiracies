Flying from SFO to LA got way worse this year thanks to Southwest
-----
I just flew to San Francisco International Airport from Los Angeles International Airport on Southwest Airlines, and boy, am I exhausted.That's not just a dumb joke. It's become a much more exhausting process in just about every way to fly between SF and Los Angeles because I'm coerced into using LAX. Now my arms are weary from lugging around luggage for much longer than I'm used to, and not even the Sprinkles Cupcakes vending machine in Terminal 1 can console me.
