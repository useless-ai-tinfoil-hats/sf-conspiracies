A brief history of names and places in the city I call Frank
-----
Last week, at Florey's Bookstore in Pacifica, a reader wanted to know exactly where the Outer, Outer, Outer, Outer Excelsior is.Many years ago, real estate agents named the area wherein the Bedlam Blue Bungalow resides by its borders: the avenues named for a railroad executive (Crocker) and the race that Wonder Woman came from (Amazon). My husband Brian and my sons Zane and Aidan may be warriors, but they are not Amazons.
Neighborhood names are funny things. Some make sense.
