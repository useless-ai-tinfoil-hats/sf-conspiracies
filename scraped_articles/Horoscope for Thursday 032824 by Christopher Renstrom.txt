Horoscope for Thursday, 03/28/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Helping people develop their potential isn't easy because they can't see what you see, but that's what makes you a good coach. You won't give up until they do.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Don't let disappointment spoil what's on offer. Although a far cry from what you asked for, it's still pretty good. Most would say you're lucky.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): What begins as a misadventure - like finding a lost object or changing seats - puts you in contact
