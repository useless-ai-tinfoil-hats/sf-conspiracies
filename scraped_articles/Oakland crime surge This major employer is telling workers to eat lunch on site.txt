Jolted by a surge of crime in Oakland last year, at least two major downtown businesses are launching safety measures to protect employees â€” ranging from rides to the office, to private security, to recommendations to eat lunch on site.A representative of Blue Shield, the health insurance provider that moved its corporate headquarters from San Francisco to Oakland in 2019, said Friday that the company would offer "various options" to keep employees safe when they come to the office.
