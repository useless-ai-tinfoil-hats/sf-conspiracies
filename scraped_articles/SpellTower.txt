SpellTower
-----
A fresh take on the old-fashioned word search, SpellTower clears out any words you find, with the ultimate goal to strategically clear out an entire board. Get an extra hit of dopamine with bonus clears; if you make a 5+ letter word, all adjacent tiles get cleared out too. Using rare letters (J,Q,X,V) will clear out an entire rowâ€“ but take care to not clear out the vowels you need. Players often stick with a specific strategy: start at the bottom, focus on keeping the columns even, or knock out
