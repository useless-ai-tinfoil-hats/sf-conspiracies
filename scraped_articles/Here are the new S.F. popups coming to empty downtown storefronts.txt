-----
San Francisco has announced the next wave of city-backed pop-up businesses opening in empty downtown storefronts, part of an ongoing initiative from Mayor London Breed's administration to inject more energy into the struggling urban core.Starting in June, eight new pop-ups will debut in rent-free commercial spaces around the East Cut, Financial District and Yerba Buena neighborhoods for three months each, with the option to extend their leases if all goes well, officials said Thursday.
