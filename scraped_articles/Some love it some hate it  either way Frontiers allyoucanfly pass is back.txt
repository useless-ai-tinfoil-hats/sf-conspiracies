-----
For many travelers, the all-you-can-fly GoWild! Pass from Frontier Airlines sounds too good to be true. After all, the ultra-low-cost carrier's pass promises "an unlimited number of flights" available over 300 days of the year, with access to all U.S. destinations, including Puerto Rico.The carrier, headquartered in Denver, is for the flyer who might find a basic economy ticket a financial stretch and is willing to waive a traditional airline's comforts in exchange for a cheaper fare.
