One hundred twenty acres of the Upper Zayante Watershed in the Santa Cruz Mountains were recently donated to the Sempervirens Fund by anonymous private landowners, marking a major step forward in conservation efforts that could aid in the recovery of endangered coho salmon and help support the habitat of other native species living in the area, per a Thursday news release from the group, which was founded in 1900 and is California's first land trust.Laura McLendon, director of land
