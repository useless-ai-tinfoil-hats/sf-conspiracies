Just-renovated Disneyland land partly closes due to ongoing issues
-----
Large parts of Disneyland's most recently refurbished land are already partially closed after a series of "persistent problems" plagued the renovation.Toontown closed in 2022 for a year as part of a major reimagining. During the downtime, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway ride was added to the land, as well as a few kid-friendly play areas, including Centoonial Park and Goofy's How-to-Play Yard.
Almost from day one, these areas have shown a propensity for significant wear and tear.
