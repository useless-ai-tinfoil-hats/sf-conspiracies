New Giants Melvin and Chapman have 'unfinished business’ after time with A's
-----
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – It's worth keeping an eye on how Matt Chapman and manager Bob Melvin's history together with the Oakland A's translates on this San Francisco Giants team.The way Chapman sees it, he and Melvin have some "unfinished business" to resolve from their seasons together in Oakland. Chapman was a core figure on Melvin's A's teams that made three consecutive postseason berths (2018-20) before it was stripped for parts after the 2021 season due to ownership's shoestring budget.
