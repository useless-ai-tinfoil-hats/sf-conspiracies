'The vibe got weird': San Francisco festival accused of ripping off attendees
-----
The West Coast Taco & Beer Festival was supposed to play out like every other culinary spectacle in California.On Saturday, Julio Buendia, along with hundreds of other people, lined up at the Midway in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood for the hourslong event, which promised unlimited tacos and bottomless beer samples. The 30-year-old tech worker and festival veteran paid $60 for early bird tickets, but before he even stepped through the door, he noticed problems start to unfold.
