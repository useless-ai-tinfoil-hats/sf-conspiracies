The Chris Paul Effect is real. Which Warriors will benefit the most?
-----
The Chris Paul Effect is real, and here is proof to support its existence.Paul is the only player in NBA history to be part of four teams that set franchise records for wins in a season. He did it with the New Orleans Hornets, the Los Angeles Clippers, the Houston Rockets, and more recently with the Phoenix Suns. The Golden State Warriors, coming off a season in which they finished 44-38 with a second-round playoff exit, are expecting a similar impact after acquiring the 12-time All-Star
