30-year-old downtown S.F. gym closes: ‘Never been able to recover’
-----
A Crunch gym in downtown San Francisco has closed after 30 years, becoming the latest longtime business to fall victim to aftershocks from the pandemic and remote work.The gym spanned three levels inside the historic Sharon Building at 55 New Montgomery St. and closed at the end of March. It had "never been able to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic," according to a sign posted in the now closed space, whose windows have been papered over.
