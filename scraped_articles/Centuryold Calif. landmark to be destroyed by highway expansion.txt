Century-old Calif. landmark to be destroyed by highway expansion
-----
A mysterious, and beloved, century-old landmark in the middle of California is soon to be destroyed.About 10 miles north of Fresno on Highway 99, two trees have long represented the dividing line between Northern and Southern California. Commonly known as "where the palm meets the pine," the contrasting trees standing in the highway's median are thought to date back to the 1920s, though no one is 100% sure.
Next year, both are slated to be uprooted to make way for a highway
