Please stop sharing the clip of a Ravens player sarcastically saying he doesn't respect the 49ers
-----
A viral clip of a Ravens player saying he doesn't respect the 49ers is a good reminder about why you can't really trust the internet.When Ravens safety Marlon Humphrey was asked about the 49ers-Ravens Christmas Day game on his "Punch Line" podcast Wednesday, he began with a quick quip about the 49ers: "I don't respect 'em." When his co-host, Jack Settleman, asked him whom he doesn't respect, Humphrey replied, "I don't respect a single person on their football team."
