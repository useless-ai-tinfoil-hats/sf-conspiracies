Warriors offense without Curry and Green runs dry in loss to Mavericks
-----
DALLAS — The Golden State Warriors proved capable this week of winning without Stephen Curry.But winning Wednesday without Draymond Green as well proved too tall a task against the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center.
Without Curry (sprained right ankle) and Green — a late scratch with a sore lower back — Golden State fell 109-99, settling further into the Western Conference's No. 10 seed.
Jonathan Kuminga kept the Warriors (34-31) afloat with a team-high 27 points
