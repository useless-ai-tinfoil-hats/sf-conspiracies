-----
An adult film star in San Francisco applied to change her name to Candi Bimbo Doll, a name she has used for years, and was turned down by a judge who said "Bimbo" was offensive. But while some people might feel that way, it's her choice, a state appeals court said Thursday.People have a right to change their name as long as the new name is not intended to confuse or defraud the public and is not "universally recognized as being offensive," the 1st District Court of Appeal said in
