Review: ‘Hit Man’ is yet another good movie from director Richard Linklater
-----
Sooner or later, we're going to have to have a conversation about Richard Linklater being one of America's best filmmakers.His movies have a consistent emotional intelligence, worn lightly. His worst movies are at least interesting ("Where'd You Go, Bernadette," "Last Flag Flying"), and he has made four masterpieces (the three "Before" movies and "Boyhood"). In between, he grinds out one good movie after the other, including his latest, "Hit Man."
Perhaps what's keeping Linklater
