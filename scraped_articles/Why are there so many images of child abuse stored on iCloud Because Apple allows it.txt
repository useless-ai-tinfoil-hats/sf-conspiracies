Why are there so many images of child abuse stored on iCloud? Because Apple allows it
-----
Earlier this year, a man in Washington state was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for sexually abusing his girlfriend's 7-year-old stepdaughter. As part of their investigation, authorities also discovered the man had been storing known images and videos of child sexual abuse on his Apple iCloud account for four years.Why was this man able to maintain a collection of illegal and sexually exploitative content of children for so long? Because Apple wasn't looking for it.
