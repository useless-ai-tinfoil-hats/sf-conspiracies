-----
Regarding "Guilty: Trump becomes first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes" (Politics & Policy, SFChronicle.com, May 30):Critics endanger system
The validity of our judiciary system has been inviolate since 1789. A jury made up of 12 peers decides whether or not to convict the accused. Former President Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges by a jury of his peers.
Whether or not you believe that he was guilty, we must presume he received a fair trial.
