Steve Garveyâ€™s dodgy campaign for Senate could land him on the November ballot
-----
Steve Garvey, now the leading Republican candidate for California's U.S. Senate seat, started his career on the left.The left side of the infield, that is. When the Los Angeles Dodgers first called up Garvey to the majors in 1969, he played third base.
But Garvey on the left was a defensive disaster. He had a powerful arm, but it was dangerously inaccurate. He threw so many balls over the first baseman's head and into the stands that fans began bringing gloves to defend themselves.
