Stevie Nicks admits Fleetwood Mac will never reunite
-----
Fleetwood Mac, one of the most critically and commercially successful bands in rock music history, is no more. Stevie Nicks, fresh off a headlining set at BottleRock Napa Valley, confirmed as much in an interview with Mojo magazine.While Fleetwood Mac was known as a quintessential Los Angeles band, two of its key members, Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, had deep ties to the San Francisco Bay Area. Buckingham was born in Palo Alto and Nicks lived in the Bay Area for a time while growing up.
