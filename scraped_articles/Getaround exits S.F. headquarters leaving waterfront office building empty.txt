Getaround exits S.F. headquarters, leaving waterfront office building empty
-----
The past year at peer-to-peer car sharing service Getaround was marked by major restructuring efforts that included staff cuts and the shedding of prime San Francisco real estate.Last spring the San Francisco company laid off 10% of its workforce as it sought to position itself for long-term growth and "sustainable profitability" in light of worsening economic conditions. And, by the fall, Getaround ended its San Francisco headquarters lease prematurely.
