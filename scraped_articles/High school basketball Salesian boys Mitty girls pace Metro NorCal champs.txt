High school basketball: Salesian boys, Mitty girls pace Metro NorCal champs
-----
One took great resolve, grit and not one, but two comebacks. The other was keyed by a 16-0 avalanche to start the game.Salesian-Richmond's boys and Mitty's girls took separate routes to win Northern California Open Division championships, but both are headed to Sacramento's Golden 1 Center just the same.
The nationally recognized programs lead seven Metro squads that advanced to the state-championship games Friday and Saturday following NorCal title victories Tuesday night.
