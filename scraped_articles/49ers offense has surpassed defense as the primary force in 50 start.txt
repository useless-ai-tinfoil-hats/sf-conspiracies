49ers' offense has surpassed defense as the primary force in 5-0 start
-----
After the San Francisco 49ers defense limited the high-powered Cowboys to their second-fewest yards since 2020 and their fewest first downs since 2007 in a 42-10 win Sunday, linebacker Fred Warner raved about â€¦ the offense."I've been a part of a lot of good teams since I've been here," Warner said, "but the way the offense is playing is unlike anything I've ever seen. That just lets me know, as long as the defense is doing our job, we'll always have a chance."
