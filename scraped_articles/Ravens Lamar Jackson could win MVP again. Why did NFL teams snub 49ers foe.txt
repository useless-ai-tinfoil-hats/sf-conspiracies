Lamar Jackson was there for the taking last spring. Against all logic, there were no takers.Given that some of the coaches and general managers who passed on the chance to acquire the electrifying quarterback have since been fired, or soon will be, that's a decision that many would like to take back.
Looking back, it almost seems laughable. And it would be, if it weren't such a depressing indictment of powerful people — including owners — who are purported to be good at this. Yes,
