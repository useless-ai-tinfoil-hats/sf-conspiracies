Arik Armstead is preparing for Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott this week, but a message he posted on social media Monday night meant the San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle is also addressing why he appeared to be panning another NFC East QB.Armstead expressed his frustration as the Giants' Daniel Jones was dropped for 10 sacks, the most a QB has taken since 2018, in a 24-3 loss to the Seahawks on Monday. The performance came a week after the 49ers had just two sacks in a 30-12 win
