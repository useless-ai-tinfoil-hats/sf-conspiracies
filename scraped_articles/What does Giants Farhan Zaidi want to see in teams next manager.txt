-----
Farhan Zaidi got a bit more specific Tuesday on what he wants in the new manager of the San Francisco Giants."We want somebody who can be an effective recruiter as we go into free agency," Zaidi said two days after the Giants' latest disappointing season ended and four days after he fired Gabe Kapler. "Like every organization, we want to build a brand of players wanting to come here and play here, and I think the manager is a big part of that."
