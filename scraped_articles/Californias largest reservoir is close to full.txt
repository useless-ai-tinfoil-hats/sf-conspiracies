California's largest reservoir is close to full
-----
California's past two wet winters have given the state's water supply a remarkable boost and stamped out the drought. A snowpack that had been below normal for two years was epic last year and this year. Rivers that were running low are now rushing. Reservoirs that were depleted in dry years are at last brimming with water.Perhaps one of the best examples of this remarkable turn of events is Shasta Lake. Three years ago, the lake was almost 185 feet from being full, according to the U.S.
