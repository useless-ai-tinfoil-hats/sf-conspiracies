If someone's pet dog is bitten by a rabid animal and becomes infected, it will die a dramatic and painful death. During that time, it may expose its owners, veterinary personnel and other contacts to the virus, creating risk of disease, death and a need for costly public health investigations and containment efforts.The disease is transmitted to humans primarily through animal bites.
