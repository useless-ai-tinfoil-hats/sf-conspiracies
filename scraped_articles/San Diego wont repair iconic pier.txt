San Diego won't repair iconic pier
-----
San Diego won't repair its historic Ocean Beach Pier, the city announced today in a report, leaving the iconic landmark roped off for the foreseeable future. Instead, the city will focus on replacing it.The 58-year-old pier had been heavily damaged by high tides and winter storms in recent years, shuttering it since October 2023. But studies dating back to 2018 have recommended a complete replacement, deeming the repairs too costly and the damage too extensive.
