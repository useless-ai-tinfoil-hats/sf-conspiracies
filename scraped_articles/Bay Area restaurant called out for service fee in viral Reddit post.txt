Bay Area restaurant called out for service fee in viral Reddit post
-----
A viral Reddit post that's garnered more than 24,000 clicks has called out a Bay Area restaurant over its automatic service fee.Earlier this month, a Reddit user shared a post to complain about Pho Ha Noi's 18% service charge that is added to all party sizes, including single diners. Included in the post was a photo of the Reddit user's receipt with a red circle around the surcharge memo at the bottom that reads, "For parties of 1 or larger, a 18% gratuity is applied automatically."
