SF Giants are trolling the Dodgers harder than ever this weekend
-----
This weekend might be the trolliest weekend in the history of the San Francisco Giants' bicoastal rivalry with the Los Angeles Dodgers.The Giants have a giveaway item for both weekend games against the Dodgers. On Saturday, the first 20,000 fans will receive a "Beat LA Aloha Shirt," with the rivalry call all along the patterned shirt.
Sunday's giveaway is less direct but far more trolling: The first 15,000 fans will receive "Mickey Mouse Ears Hat," courtesy of a NorCal-SoCal
