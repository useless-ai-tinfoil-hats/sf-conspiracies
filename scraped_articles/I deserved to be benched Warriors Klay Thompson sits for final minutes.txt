‘I deserved to be benched’: Warriors’ Klay Thompson sits for final minutes
-----
PHOENIX — On the court, Klay Thompson couldn't hide his frustration. He became visibly upset during a fourth-quarter timeout, shouting at no one in particular and throwing a couple of towels. Stephen Curry came over to calm Thompson.Then, in the locker room afterward, Thompson stayed composed. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr kept him out of the closing lineup Tuesday night, an extraordinarily rare occurrence and something Thompson initially called "strange."
