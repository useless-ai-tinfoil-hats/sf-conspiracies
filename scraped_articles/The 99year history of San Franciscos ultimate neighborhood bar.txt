The 99-year history of San Francisco's ultimate neighborhood bar
-----
I am not a fan of carpet in a bar. You just don't know what's lurking in there, what's been spilled and forgotten â€¦ or ignored. I don't even like carpet in a home for the exact same reason. How often do people with carpet actually clean it? Vacuuming doesn't count. There's carpet in the Page, but even that can't keep me from loving it."It was here when I bought the place," Bob Wait tells me with a chuckle. I shudder as I look down aghast at the floor of the bar he's owned since 2004.
