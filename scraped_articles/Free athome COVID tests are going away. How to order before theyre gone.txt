Free at-home COVID tests are going away. How to order before theyâ€™re gone
-----
This is the final week for Americans to request free COVID-19 tests by mail from the federal government, as authorities announced they will halt the program after Friday.Since the January 2022 beginning of the program, which offered four at-home kits of two tests each to every U.S. household via the Postal Service, more than 1.8 billion units have been distributed nationwide.
The program was previously paused due to a lack of funding, but the Biden administration revived it
