At Sundance, kids hawk Stanley tumblers on the street at steep markups
-----
PARK CITY, Utah — At the Sundance Film Festival, it's a little too chilly to sell lemonade. Several kids post up outside Park City High School with a coffee stand to sell to those waiting in line for movies, but on Main Street, the wares are decidedly more upscale.Seated on a bench right outside the Park City Transit Center, Leah and Lucas Shapiro— age 13 and 10 — wear matching smiley-face beanies while holding a sign that reads: "We are selling SOLD OUT SUNDANCE STANLEY TUMBLERS."
