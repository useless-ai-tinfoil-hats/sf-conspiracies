The Bay Areaâ€™s best entertainment deal is a $4.60 ride on public transit

There's often a point during my San Francisco Bay Ferry commute when I fantasize about never getting off the boat.This is less outlandish than it sounds. The ferries have Wi-Fi, bathrooms, power outlets, bike parking and a full bar with mixed drinks and snacks. Add a shower, a hammock and maybe some lime slices to avoid scurvy, and you could build a pretty good life for yourself forever shuttling back and forth across the 10 miles of water between Alameda and San Francisco.
