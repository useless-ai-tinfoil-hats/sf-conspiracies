S.F.’s famous ‘Full House’ Victorian back on the market for $6.5 million
-----
The San Francisco Victorian famously featured in the 1980s sitcom "Full House" and its spinoff, "Fuller House," has returned to the market with an asking price of $6.5 million.Located at 1709 Broderick St. in Lower Pacific Heights, the residence was prominently depicted in the opening credits of both series. However, its interior hardly resembles the fictional Tanner family homes from the shows, as those were filmed on a Warner Bros. studio set in Los Angeles.
