The day Willie Mays drove me and my best friend home in his pink Thunderbird
-----
My mom dropped us off at the main entrance to Seals Stadium. "Remember to save some of that money (15 cents) for the bus and streetcar home!"There we were, best friend Kent Eagleson and me, at a Giants-Dodgers game in 1959.
During the game, Eagleson casually said, "After the game, let's ask Willie for a ride home!"
"What? Willie? Willie Mays? We can't ask Mays for a ride home! We're just a couple of kids! Where do we find him? What if he says no?"
Game ends, Eagleson
