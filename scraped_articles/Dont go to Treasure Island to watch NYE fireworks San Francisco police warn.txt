Don't go to Treasure Island to watch NYE fireworks, San Francisco police warn
-----
San Francisco police are asking people to avoid going to Treasure Island on Sunday night to view New Year's Eve fireworks. For the last year, there have been myriad road closures and detours on the artificial island as construction on thousands of new homes and apartments takes place. Some of these road closures will be permanent as the city reconfigures traffic on Treasure Island. For now, these roads are closed:—Avenue of Palms between Tradewinds Ave. and 9th Street
—California
