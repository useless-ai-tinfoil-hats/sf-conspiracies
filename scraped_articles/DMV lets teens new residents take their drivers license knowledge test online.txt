Aspiring drivers and new residents can now skip the line and opt to take their California driver's license knowledge test from home.The California Department of Motor Vehicles announced last week that it was expanding its remote testing option to driver's license applicants under the age of 18 and individuals moving to California from other states. Previously, the option was only available for drivers or motorcyclists renewing their licenses or new applicants over the age of 18.
