Patagonia's cool-weather gear is up to 50% off at Dick's Sporting Goods
-----
It's hard to imagine with the scorching heat roasting many parts of the country, but winter will be here before we know it. And the best time to rack up on cold-weather gear is when it's too dang hot to think about anything but keeping cool and staying that way. That's what's had me perusing Patagonia's puffer jackets and fleecy finds well ahead of a bucket-list trip next year to Iceland â€” well, that and the fact that Dick's Sporting Goods has them up to 50% off.Patagonia Men's Nano Puff
