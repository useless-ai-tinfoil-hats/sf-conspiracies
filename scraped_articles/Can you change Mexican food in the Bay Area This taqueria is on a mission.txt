Can you change Mexican food in the Bay Area? This taqueria is on a mission
-----
Raul Medina's mission began with changing Mexican food. He wants his Oakland pop-up-turned-restaurant, Taqueria La Venganza, to convince carnivores that the essence of the cuisine far exceeds any one ingredient, particularly meat.It's no easy feat. Displeased with the market of vegan "meats," Medina developed his own. His "carne asada," made with textured vegetable protein, also known as soy chips, has the tender bounce of steak, and a citrus-beer marinade gives it a backyard barbecue
