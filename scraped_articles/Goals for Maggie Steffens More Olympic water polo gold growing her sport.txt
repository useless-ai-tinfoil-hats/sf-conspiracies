Goals for Maggie Steffens: More Olympic water polo gold, growing her sport
-----
The queen of American water polo is back, searching for gold medal No. 4. And also some respect.When Maggie Steffens was 19, just a year removed from playing for Monte Vista High in Danville, she was the spark that lifted Team USA to its first ever gold medal in the sport, scoring 21 goals in London. Twelve years later, she is hoping to earn a fourth consecutive gold in Paris.
With coach Adam Krikorian at the helm and Steffens leading in the pool, Team USA has created a dynasty.
