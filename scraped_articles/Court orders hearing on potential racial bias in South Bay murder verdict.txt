Court orders hearing on potential racial bias in South Bay murder verdict
-----
At Jermaine Howard's murder trial for a fatal shooting in San Jose, the prosecutor repeatedly asked the Black defendant about his childhood in East Palo Alto, a community known for its minority population and reputation for violence. That was enough, a state appeals court ruled Tuesday, to support a claim of potential bias under California's Racial Justice Act.Courts "have recognized that a person's place of residence may serve as a proxy for race," said the 6th District Court of Appeal.
