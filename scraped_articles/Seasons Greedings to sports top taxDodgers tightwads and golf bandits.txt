Season's Greedings to sportsâ€™ top tax-Dodgers, tightwads and golf bandits
-----
Season's Greedings!This has been the best year ever for greed in sports. Hope you got your bag!
Shohei Ohtani sure did. Let's start with him.
The Los Angeles TaxDodgers signed the great slugger/hurler to a contract that allows the team to avoid heavy luxury-tax penalties, thus beating the system designed to somewhat equalize MLB competition. Ohtani's contract, with most of the money deferred, could allow him to avoid paying about $98 million in state taxes.
All of that
