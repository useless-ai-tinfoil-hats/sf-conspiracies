A’s shut out 7-0 by Blue Jays in Kevin Gausman’s first career 9-inn. complete game
-----
For the previous 16 games before Saturday's matchup with Toronto at the Coliseum, the Oakland Athletics hadn't been wildly successful, but they had been historically stressful.The A's went 7-9 in that stretch in which each game was decided by three runs or fewer. That tied the longest such streak (May 1969) in franchise history.
The streak ended with a thud. Former Giants right-hander Kevin Gausman threw a five-hitter and the Blue Jays used a five-run fifth inning to roll to a 7-0
