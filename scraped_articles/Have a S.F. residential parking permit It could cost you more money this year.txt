Have a S.F. residential parking permit? It could cost you more money this year
-----
Muni riders who pay via Clipper card and San Francisco residents who utilize annual parking permits could see fee increases under the Municipal Transportation Agency's plans to plug a short-term budget deficit.Those are among the proposals that officials at the SFMTA, which operates Muni and oversees city parking and taxis, will propose at a Jan. 30 budget workshop to its Board of Directors.
The increases would take effect in July if the transportation board decides to include them
