7-Elevenâ€™s coveted Japanese sandwiches have arrived in the Bay Area
-----
A prized convenience store sandwich appears to have finally made its way from 7-Eleven in Japan to the Bay Area.Earlier this summer, 7-Eleven announced that it would be launching some of the chain's coveted Japanese snacks in the United States. But it gave no indication of where or when. Then, influencers recently spotted konbini-style (or Japanese convenience store) egg salad sandwiches, one of the calling-card snacks at 7-Eleven locations in Japan, in Orange County.
