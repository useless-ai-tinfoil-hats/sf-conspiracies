'All the factors came together': How California's Park Fire blew up so fast
-----
In a matter of three days, California's Park Fire grew to a 350,012-acre monster that is consuming the bone-dry wilderness north of Chico, upending communities such as Cohasset and Forest Ranch and forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.This is the largest wildfire California has seen so far this year, and the largest wildfire since the 963,309-acre Dixie Fire in 2021. California saw relatively quiet wildfire seasons in both 2022 and 2023, with just over 300,000 acres burned
