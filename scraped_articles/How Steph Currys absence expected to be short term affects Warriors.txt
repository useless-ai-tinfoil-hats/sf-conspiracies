How Steph Curryâ€™s absence, expected to be short term, affects Warriors
-----
Turning on Thursday with Stephen Curry's right ankle were the short-term prospects of the Golden State Warriors, who lost not just a game to the Chicago Bulls, but also their leading scorer with 20 games left to play."If he is out, unfortunate, but it's part of the length of the season. It's hard to play every game, especially not having any minor injuries," fellow guard Klay Thompson said.
"We'll do well without him. We can rely on our history and how to execute without him."
