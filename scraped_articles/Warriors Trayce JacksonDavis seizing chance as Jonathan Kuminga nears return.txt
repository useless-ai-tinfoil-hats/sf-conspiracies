Warriorsâ€™ Trayce Jackson-Davis seizing chance as Jonathan Kuminga nears return

Jonathan Kuminga's lingering absence with knee tendinitis comes at an inconvenient time for the Golden State Warriors as they try to cement a spot in the NBA postseason.But Kuminga's temporary departure from the starting lineup also created an opening for rookie center Trayce Jackson-Davis, and that has worked out nicely for the Warriors.
Kuminga missed his fourth consecutive game Tuesday night, when the Warriors beat Dallas 104-100 at Chase Center. He's expected to return Thursday
