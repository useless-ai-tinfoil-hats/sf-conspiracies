Multiple cloud layers block the Bay Area's view of 'ring of fire' eclipse
-----
In true Bay Area fashion, the region's view of Saturday morning's highly anticipated "ring of fire" eclipse was mostly blocked by multiple layers of clouds.A front passing over the area caused mid- and higher-level clouds to form above low-level clouds typical of this time of the year, said Brayden Murdock, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office. This resulted in a blanket of cloud cover over the region and less-than-stellar eclipse viewing conditions.
