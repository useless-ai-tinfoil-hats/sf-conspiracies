Review: Matthew Vaughn’s ‘Argylle’ starts out OK, then goes completely to pieces
-----
What has gone wrong in director Matthew Vaughn's process that he can offer up an awful mess like "Argylle" and just hope that nobody will notice? He must notice. This is the director who gave us "Layer Cake" (2004), "Stardust" (2007) and "Kick-Ass" (2010), so he not only knows what we know, which is how to recognize a good movie. He knows how to make one.Certainly, you don't make one this way, with wild tonal shifts, absurd turns of story, and action sequences of mass killing,
