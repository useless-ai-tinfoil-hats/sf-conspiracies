49ersâ€™ Trent Williams will return for 14th season with sights on record
-----
If there was any doubt, Trent Williams erased it Wednesday: The San Francisco 49ers' 35-year-old left tackle said he'd be back for his 14th NFL season in 2024."Oh, yeah," Williams said. "One hundred percent."
Williams caused a brief stir last year when he said he'd considered retirement two days after the 49ers lost in the NFC Championship Game. However, he's since said he's committed to his goal of becoming the sixth offensive linemen since 1925 to play into his 40s.
