Legendary roadside restaurant Pea Soup Andersen's has closed out of nowhere
-----
One of California's most recognizable roadside restaurants has closed without so much as a goodbye to longtime fans and travelers.Pea Soup Andersen's, the staple Central Coast destination in Buellton, California — just off Highway 101 en route to the Danish holiday town Solvang — has gone dark, and rumors are swirling that the property itself may be redeveloped for housing. The property was previously listed for sale for just under $5 million in 2021, but no buyer was publicly announced.
