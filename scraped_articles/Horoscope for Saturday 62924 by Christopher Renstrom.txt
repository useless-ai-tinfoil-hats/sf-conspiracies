Horoscope for Saturday, 6/29/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): The past few months have shown progress, but it's slow and feels like it can be easily overturned. Only you can decide if your new life is over before it's begun.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Sealing the deal will take longer than you think now that Saturn is retrograde. Nevertheless a detour or delay could pave the way to your destination.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): It's important to keep your cool when the people around you are losing theirs, but do it.
