New billboard outside Coachella roasts headliner Lana Del Rey
-----
Everyone loves to make fun of moody, retro singing sensation Lana Del Rey — including Lana Del Rey apparently.In the days leading up to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, a bizarre billboard has popped up on Interstate 10 near the festival grounds in Indio, California. Scrawled over a cross, in what can only be described as "s—tty tattoo font," are the words: "Has anyone else died for you?"
Underneath, in smaller text: "Lana Del Rey, SNL, Jan 14 2012."
It's a smug
