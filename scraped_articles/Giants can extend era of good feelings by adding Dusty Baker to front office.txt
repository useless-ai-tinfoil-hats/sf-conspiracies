Giants can extend era of good feelings by adding Dusty Baker to front office
-----
The San Francisco Giants took a huge step in the right direction last week when they hired Bob Melvin to manage. The hire was a reminder that the Giants are about people, not percentages; about relationships, not statistics.The Giants can continue heading on the right path with another obvious feel-good hire.
Bring Dusty Baker back into the fold. As a special adviser. A baseball guru emeritus. A director of good vibes. Whatever title he wants. But don't let him go somewhere else.
