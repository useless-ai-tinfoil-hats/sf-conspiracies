Taking a pause brings friendships, family into perspective
-----
"Take a pause," Alma texted back when I wrote her that we had a busy October: five book readings, a CT scan, a bone scan, two immunotherapy infusions, surgery to install a port.We choose friends for a reason or a season, and sometimes we choose them for life. That makes them family. We don't always know which is which. Most of my college buddies have evolved into Christmas card acquaintances, but 40 years later, the guy who sang bass in the chapel choir is still Uncle David to my sons.
