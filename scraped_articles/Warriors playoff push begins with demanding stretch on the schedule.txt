Warriorsâ€™ playoff push begins with demanding stretch on the schedule
-----
As the Golden State Warriors resume play Thursday night, they can set aside any notion of pacing themselves through the long, grueling grind of an NBA regular season. Now it's a frantic dash to the finish line.The Warriors (27-26) stand 10th in the Western Conference with 29 games left. They openly crave climbing to sixth, as they did last season, and avoiding the crapshoot of the play-in tournament.
It's a reasonable goal, especially given Golden State's surge before the All-Star
