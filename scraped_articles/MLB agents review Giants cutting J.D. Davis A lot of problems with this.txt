MLB agents review Giants cutting J.D. Davis: ‘A lot of problems with this’
-----
PHOENIX — J.D. Davis won't be out of work soon.The erstwhile San Francisco Giants third baseman, let go Monday with the team on the hook for just $1.15 million of the $6.9 million he was awarded in arbitration, has drawn interest from seven teams and is likely to sign with one of them within a few days, according to an industry source.
There remains a chance that the union will file a grievance against the Giants for releasing him and providing him only 30 days' termination pay.
