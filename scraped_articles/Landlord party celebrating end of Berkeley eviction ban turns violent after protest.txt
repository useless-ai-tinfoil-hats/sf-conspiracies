Landlord party celebrating end of Berkeley eviction ban turns violent after protest
-----
Clashes between housing advocates and landlords turned violent outside a party thrown by landlords to celebrate the end of Berkeley's eviction moratorium.The Tuesday event was organized by the Berkeley Property Owners Association in order to celebrate the end of the "severe financial hardship for small family-owned businesses" being imposed by the moratorium, the organization said in a statement. The pandemic-inspired ordinance banned landlords from evicting tenants due to unpaid rent.
