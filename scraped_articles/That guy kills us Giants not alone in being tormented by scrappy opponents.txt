BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Every team has an opponent or two who just torches them.For the San Francisco Giants, that's long been Nolan Arenado, who entered Thursday having clobbered 33 homers and driven in 112 runs in 151 games against them — a terrific full season's worth of production against just one team.
And yet, it's the — how do we say this nicely? — scrappy players, the non-All-Stars who drive fans nuts when they consistently beat their clubs. Your Yankee-killer Marco
