Known hockey jerk enraged by collision with ref during Sharks game
-----
It took until the third game of the season for something to finally go right for the winless San Jose Sharks, although that good fortune didn't even come from their own team.Late in the second period, Hurricanes defenseman Dmitry Orlov had his shot blocked, causing a chase for the puck at the boards. Carolina defenseman Tony DeAngelo tried to join in the pursuit but was stopped dead in his tracks, and knocked to the ice, when he ran into referee Graham Skilliter's elbow.
