Slow start by Warriors Andrew Wiggins doesnâ€™t concern Steve Kerr or teammates
-----
Andrew Wiggins has not been at his best through the Golden State Warriors' first five games of the season, and the forward has not tried to hide it."There are a lot of things I could do better, for sure," Wiggins told the Chronicle on Monday. "I don't think I've done anything too good, to be honest with you. I can improve on everything."
Wiggins, viewed as one of the Warriors' top scorers and defenders, is averaging 11.4 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.6 turnovers per game this season
