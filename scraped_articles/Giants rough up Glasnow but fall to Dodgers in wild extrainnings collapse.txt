Giants rough up Glasnow but fall to Dodgers in wild extra-innings collapse
-----
Sean Hjelle's ERA didn't deserve the thrashing the Los Angeles Dodgers had in store.One of the San Francisco Giants' most effective relievers this season, Hjelle took the mound in the 10th inning Saturday evening with a 2.33 ERA and possible plans to help out with another bullpen game for Sunday's series finale. But a series of unfortunate events raised Hjelle's ERA to 3.54 as he saw a 7-7 tie he helped preserve in the 10th inning transform into a 14-7 loss in 11 innings at Oracle Park
