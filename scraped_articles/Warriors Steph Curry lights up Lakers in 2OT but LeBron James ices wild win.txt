Warriorsâ€™ Steph Curry lights up Lakers in 2OT but LeBron James ices wild win
-----
Steve Kerr might have ripped the referees the way Stephen Curry ripped his blue and gold Golden State Warriors jersey Saturday while walking off the Chase Center court after a 145-144 double-overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.But Kerr's mother, Ann, was seated at his postgame news conference, giving the 58-year-old coach all the reason to refrain.
"I want to be on my best behavior, so I'm not going comment on the 43 free throws (the Lakers shot) to our 16," he said, wryly.
