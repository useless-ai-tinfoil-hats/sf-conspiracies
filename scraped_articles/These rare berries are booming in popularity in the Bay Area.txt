One-year-old Aashana Gajula couldn't seem to stop stuffing mulberries into her mouth. She grabbed the long, purple berries off the tray in front of her with pudgy hands, staining her face red as she ate.Her family kept supplying her with fruits they were picking off the nearby shamrock-green trees. Ripe mulberries fell into their hands at a light touch. Nearby, berries lay scattered across the ground, adding pops of color to the grass and straw at Very Mulberry's farm in Brentwood.
