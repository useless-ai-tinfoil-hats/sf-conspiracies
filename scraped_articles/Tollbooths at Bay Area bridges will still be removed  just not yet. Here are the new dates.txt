Tollbooths at Bay Area bridges will still be removed — just not yet. Here are the new dates
-----
Caltrans and its human toll collectors abandoned the tollbooths on the Bay Bridge and the other six state-owned Bay Area toll bridges at the start of the coronavirus pandemic — but the tollbooths remain.The Bay Area Toll Authority, which oversees operation of the bridges, had planned to start removing the empty booths last August and finish the last ones — on the Bay Bridge — by the fall of 2026.
Those plans, however, have been delayed and will cost more, the Chronicle has learned.
