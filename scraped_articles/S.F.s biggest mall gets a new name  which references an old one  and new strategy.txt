S.F.’s biggest mall gets a new name — which references an old one — and new strategy
-----
The new management of San Francisco's biggest, half-empty mall is going back to the past while seeking to revive it for the future.What was known until last year as Westfield San Francisco Centre is being rebranded as Emporium Centre San Francisco, a nod to a historic 1896 name for a portion of the mall known as the Emporium. It was the first department store on the West Coast.
Mall receiver Trident Pacific and retail broker JLL said a new logo, signs and website are coming soon.
