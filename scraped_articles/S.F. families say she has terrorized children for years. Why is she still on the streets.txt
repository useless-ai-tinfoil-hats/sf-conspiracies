When Yelena Dunduchenko began working as a nanny in San Francisco's Richmond District several years ago, other caregivers offered her a warning and showed her pictures of a sandy-haired woman named Kim Andrews who was known for harassing people with children.It didn't take long for Dunduchenko to encounter her.
"She started screaming and saying, 'I am going to take your child, I am going to kill you,'" Dunduchenko said of the 2020 altercation. "It was really scary."
