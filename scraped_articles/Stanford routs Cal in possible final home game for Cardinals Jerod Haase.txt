Stanford routs Cal in possible final home game for Cardinalâ€™s Jerod Haase
-----
Senior Night at Maples Pavilion on Thursday had a profound air of finality.Not only was the Cal-Stanford matchup the last Pac-12 regular-season game for both teams before they move to the ACC next season, but it very well could have been the last home game for Jerod Haase as the Cardinal's head coach.
If it was Haase's swan song at Maples, the Cardinal made it a memorable one. Stanford went 12-for-24 from beyond the arc and overwhelmed the Bears 80-58.
