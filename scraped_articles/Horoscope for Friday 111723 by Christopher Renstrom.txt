Horoscope for Friday, 11/17/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): You may be asked to represent the interests of the group but before you do make sure that you're acting as their mouthpiece and not their scapegoat.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Don't be too dispassionate when describing the dilemma you find yourself in or people won't think you need their help.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Instead of begrudging a rival's success, research how s/he made it happen. What worked for this person can work for you, too.
