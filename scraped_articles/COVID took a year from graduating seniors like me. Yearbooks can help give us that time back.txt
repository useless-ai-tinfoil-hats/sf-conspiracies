COVID took a year from graduating seniors like me. Yearbooks can help give us that time back
-----
I lost my first year of high school to Zoom in 2020. Not just my first day or first week, but the entire first year. This jarring start to a new phase of life set a pace that marked high school milestones strangely.Now, with graduation approaching, I look back on those milestones — the ups and downs of four pivotal years — and reflect. What can I remember? What should I remember? What will I forget?
This is where the yearbook comes into play.
Yearbooks allow us to slow down
