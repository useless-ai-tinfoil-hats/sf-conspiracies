Major Bay Area Italian restaurant unveils dreamy new market
-----
The aisles of the Bay Area's newest market will be packed with Italian olive oils, dried pastas, three shelves of tinned fish and fresh-spun gelato â€” the makings of an Italian feast from one of the region's top restaurants.Il Mercato di Che Fico, from David Nayfeld and Matt Brewer, the owners of the popular Che Fico, will open Thursday, March 21, in Menlo Park. It's steps away from Che Fico's new sister restaurant at Springline, a splashy, food-packed development on El Camino Real.
