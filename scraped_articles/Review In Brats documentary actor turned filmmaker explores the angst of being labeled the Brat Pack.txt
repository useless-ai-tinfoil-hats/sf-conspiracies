Review: In ‘Brats’ documentary, actor turned filmmaker explores the angst of being labeled the Brat Pack
-----
The strength of "Brats," a new documentary debuting on Hulu, derives from its weirdness.It's a film about the Brat Pack, the famous group of young actors who emerged in the 1980s, in films such as "The Breakfast Club" (1985), "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) and "Pretty in Pink" (1986). But it's not a history of the Brat Pack or a study of its cultural influence. Rather, it's a film in which actor-turned-documentarian Andrew McCarthy discusses the trauma of being labeled as a "Brat Pack" actor.
