Smoke rose above Mission and Third streets in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon due to a fire in an underground PG&E electrical vault, the San Francisco Fire Department said."Think of a bank vault but underground for wires and stuff," Capt. Justin Schorr, a spokesperson for the fire department, told SFGATE at 1:30 p.m. "There may be flames underground, right now we have smoke coming from two of the vault access ports â€” also called manhole covers."
