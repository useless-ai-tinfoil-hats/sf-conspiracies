Yosemite trail to Half Dome will be open limited hours starting in July
-----
A key segment of the wildly popular Mist Trail in Yosemite National Park, which suffered a landslide two months ago, will be closed during certain times to hikers beginning July 1.Starting from the eastern end of Yosemite Valley, the Mist Trail traces the Merced River through a gorge up to the scenic Vernal Fall and then, a bit farther, to Nevada Fall. It's a critical path for day hikers heading to the Half Dome cables and also plugs backpackers into the park's vast granite wilderness
