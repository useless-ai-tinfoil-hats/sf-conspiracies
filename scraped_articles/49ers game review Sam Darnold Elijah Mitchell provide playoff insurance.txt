49ers game review: Sam Darnold, Elijah Mitchell provide playoff insurance
-----
Sam Darnold looked great on the San Francisco 49ers' opening touchdown drive Sunday, partly because his guards took turns looking bad.With interior linemen Aaron Banks and Spencer Burford increasing his degree of difficulty by missing blocks in a 21-20 loss to the Rams, the 49ers' backup quarterback still didn't miss under-pressure throws.
It began on the game's second snap. Banks whiffed on nose tackle Bobby Brown, who had immediate up-the-middle pressure on Darnold. No problem.
