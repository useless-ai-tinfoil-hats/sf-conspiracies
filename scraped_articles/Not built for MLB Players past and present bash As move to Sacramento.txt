'Not built' for MLB: Players past and present bash A's move to Sacramento
-----
A's owner John Fisher is taking his baseball team and running away from Oakland as fast as possible.Before the team makes its still-hypothetical move to Las Vegas, the A's will set up shop at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento, the team announced Thursday morning. It will be the A's new home for at least the next three seasons. Yet a lot of baseball players — including two SFGATE spoke to on the phone — are skeptical that the facility is ready to host MLB teams.
