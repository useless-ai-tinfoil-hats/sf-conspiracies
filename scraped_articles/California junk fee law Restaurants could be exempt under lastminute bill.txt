California junk fee law: Restaurants could be exempt under last-minute bill
-----
State Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, introduced legislation Thursday that would allow California restaurants to continue to charge automatic fees to diners, potentially reversing part of a controversial state law that will otherwise make them illegal in just three weeks.Senate Bill 1524 would merely require restaurants to disclose any additional fees, such as automatic service charges, "clearly and conspicuously" on menus or "other displays," as is current practice for many food businesses.
