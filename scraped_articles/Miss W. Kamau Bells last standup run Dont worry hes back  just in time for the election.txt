Miss W. Kamau Bell’s last stand-up run? Don’t worry, he’s back — just in time for the election
-----
W. Kamau Bell is once again using Berkeley Repertory Theatre as a testing ground for new material in his quest to return to his comedy roots.The Oakland resident's limited engagement is scheduled to begin Aug. 24 at the venue's 60-seat Bakery Studio and run every Saturday through Oct. 12. He plans to perform two sets, at 4:30 and 7 p.m. each day.
Bell launched his first stand-up residency at the East Bay space in January for a three-month stint. The entire run was sold out.
