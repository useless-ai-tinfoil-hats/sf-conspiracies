Why two chefs with Michelin cred bought a Bay Area restaurant in the middle of nowhere
-----
It's empty and it's quiet. There are no cars, no people, and the only sound is white-knuckled hands squeaking on the steering wheel as I make my way down Skyline Boulevard in Woodside, California.I'm currently in the middle of a redwood grove high above the bay, 7 miles away from the nearest sign of civilization, save for a few banks of mailboxes huddled on the side of the road â€” the absolute last place in the Bay Area you'd expect to find a Michelin star contender.
But trudge far
