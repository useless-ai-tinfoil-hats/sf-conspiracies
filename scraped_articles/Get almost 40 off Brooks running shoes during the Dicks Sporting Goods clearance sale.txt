Get almost 40% off Brooks running shoes during the Dickâ€™s Sporting Goods clearance sale
-----
Heading into the latter part of summer, retailers start clearing shelf space for colder weather gear, making it the perfect time to take advantage of some great deals. Dick's Sporting Goods, for example, is having a big clearance sale right now, with steep discounts on athletic apparel, footwear, gear, and more. Though lots of products have had their prices slashed, what really caught my eye was the Brooks Ghost 15 Running Shoes, which are on sale for up to 38% off.Brooks Men's Ghost 15
