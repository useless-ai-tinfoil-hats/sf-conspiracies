Cal discus thrower breaks world record, aims to build on dadâ€™s Olympic legacy
-----
Mykolas Alekna routinely strolls unbothered across the Berkeley campus, happily blending into the crowd of more than 45,000 students.Then he returns home to Lithuania, land of renowned discus throwers, and seldom strolls unbothered anywhere.
"I'm not really a fan of it," he said last week, standing in the shade after a workout at Cal's Edwards Stadium. "That's why I like being here in the U.S. No one recognizes me, no one cares."
