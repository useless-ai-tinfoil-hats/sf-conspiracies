Fresh leeks bring a taste of spring to these arancini tinted with flavorful saffron
-----
Leeks have been making an appearance at our local farmers markets. Leeks come from the allium family of onions, garlic, chives, etc. They are mild in taste and add a lot of flavor to soups, stews, pastas and today's recipe â€” Leek and Saffron Arancini.There are two parts to a leek: the white stem and the tougher green leaves. The green leaves are cut off and the white stems are used. I cut them vertically across the middle and wash them thoroughly since they have a lot of dirt in between
