Review: 'Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In' an action-packed salute to '80s Hong Kong
-----
There are many reasons to love the 1980s and early '90s, but high on the list is the wave of films that emerged from the small, then-British colony of Hong Kong during those years.From the spine-snapping stunt work of Jackie Chan ("Project A," "Police Story," "Dragons Forever") to the rapturous early films of director Wong Kar-wai ("As Tears Go By," "Days of Being Wild"), the wuxia fantasies of Tsui Hark ("A Chinese Ghost Story") and noirish gangster thrillers from the likes of John Woo
