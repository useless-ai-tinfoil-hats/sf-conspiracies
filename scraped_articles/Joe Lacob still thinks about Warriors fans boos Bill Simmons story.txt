Joe Lacob still thinks about Warriors fans' boos, Bill Simmons story
-----
Set to begin his 14th year as the Warriors' owner, Joe Lacob has become beloved by the Golden State fan base.But in an hourlong sit-down interview with 95.7 The Game's "The Morning Roast" show on Wednesday, Lacob made it clear that the "rock bottom" moment of his tenure still sits with him, even if he says it doesn't.
