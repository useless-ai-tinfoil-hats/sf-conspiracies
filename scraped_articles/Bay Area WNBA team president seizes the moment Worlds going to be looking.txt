-----
The first few weeks on the job have been a whirlwind for Jess Smith, the president — and so far lone employee — of the Bay Area's expansion WNBA team.But one moment in particular stands out.
That came at the NBA All-Star Weekend when Smith sat courtside for the Stephen Curry-Sabrina Ionescu 3-point battle, a dramatic showcase for the synergy between the WNBA and the NBA.
"You can't ask for a better example to educate people as to how we want this to feel," Smith said.
