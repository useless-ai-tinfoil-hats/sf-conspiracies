Say goodbye to your Microsoft 365 subscription and own Microsoft Office for life
-----
Like most people, you're probably paying what feels like a fortune in subscription fees for access to Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services. That's to be expected (unfortunately), but if you're still also paying a subscription fee for Microsoft 365, it's time to kick it to the curb and own your Microsoft tools outright!You might think it'll cost you upwards of $200 — it used to — but you can now get lifetime access to Microsoft Office 2021 at a steal of a deal: $39.97 for your PC
