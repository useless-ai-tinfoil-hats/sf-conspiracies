A traditional, comforting eggplant curry that happens to be vegan
-----
Come October, I start to crave piping hot meals â€” think curries, baked dishes, stove-top pastas and stir-fries. But we also still have some summer produce in season, like eggplants. A prime dish for this time of year is one of my favorites that I used to hate as a kid but now love as an adult: Garlicky Eggplant and Potato Curry.Eggplants come in all shapes and sizes. They can be long and slender, short and stout. They come in different shades of purple, striped, all-white or even green.
