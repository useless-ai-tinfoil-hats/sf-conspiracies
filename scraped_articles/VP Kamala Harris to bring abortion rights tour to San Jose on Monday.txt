VP Kamala Harris to bring abortion rights tour to San Jose on Monday
-----
Vice President Kamala Harris will use a rally Monday in San Jose to spotlight how California has protected abortion access since the Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right to obtain the procedure.Harris has become a key figure in the 2024 election, in part because of her forcefulness on abortion rights, an issue that has helped heavily motivate voters on behalf of Democrats in the past two years since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
