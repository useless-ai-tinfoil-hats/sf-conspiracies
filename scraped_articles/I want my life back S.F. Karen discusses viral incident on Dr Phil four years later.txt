‘I want my life back’: ‘S.F. Karen’ discusses viral incident on ‘Dr Phil’ four years later
-----
Four years after being dubbed "S.F. Karen," Lisa Alexander says she's finally ready to share her side of the story.Alexander was recorded interrogating James Juanillo, who was stenciling "Black Lives Matter" on a wall outside of his Pacific Heights home in June 2020. She immediately received public backlash when the video went viral.
While she apologized to Juanillo shortly after the confrontation, Alexander appeared on "Dr. Phil Primetime" earlier this month to defend her actions.
