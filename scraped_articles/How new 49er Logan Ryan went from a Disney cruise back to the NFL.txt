How new 49er Logan Ryan went from a Disney cruise back to the NFL
-----
The relaxing Disney holiday cruise Logan Ryan had envisioned last month was decidedly not chill.He spent much of his days sweating and studying. And there was another thing Ryan didn't expect on his Thanksgiving voyage to the Bahamas with his wife and two young children.
"There wasn't any drinking on the cruise, unfortunately," he said.
Ryan, 32, had a self-imposed no-booze cruise because he received a significant call just before he boarded: San Francisco 49ers general
