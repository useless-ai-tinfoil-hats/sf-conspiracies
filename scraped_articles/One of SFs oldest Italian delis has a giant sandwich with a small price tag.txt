One of SF's oldest Italian delis has a giant sandwich with a small price tag
-----
For a delicatessen that's roughly 600 square feet, San Francisco's classic Italian shop Lucca Delicatessen has managed to captivate locals with its roster of imported goods, handmade ravioli and traditional Italian sandwiches for nearly a century.Not much has changed at the Italian deli since it opened its doors in San Francisco's Marina District in 1929. You can still find dry-aged salami hanging from ceiling hooks and old-school number cards being used to place customer orders.
