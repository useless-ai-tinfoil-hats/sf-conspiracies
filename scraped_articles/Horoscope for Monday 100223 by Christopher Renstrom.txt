Horoscope for Monday, 10/02/23 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES. (March 20 - April 19): The threshold between your conscious and unconscious minds drops when Mercury opposes Neptune. This could make you surprisingly psychic or just sleepy.TAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You may feel disillusioned, but don't get too upset. What you have now is better than nothing. Moreover you can build on it.
GEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): It' s OK to be enthralled, but don't go too far. Your gullibility reads loud and clear today. Don't advertise.
