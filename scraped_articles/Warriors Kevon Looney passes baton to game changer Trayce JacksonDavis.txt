Warriors’ Kevon Looney passes baton to ‘game changer’ Trayce Jackson-Davis
-----
DALLAS — Kevon Looney's conversation with Draymond Green ended the moment Trayce Jackson-Davis palmed the ball with 1:14 left to play Monday night in the Golden State Warriors' 112-102 victory at San Antonio."I know when he palms it in the left hand, he's going to try to go dunk it," said Looney, to whom Jackson-Davis declared pregame he'd attempt to dunk over rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama.
"He made an incredible play. It's cool to see. Especially because we talked about it."
