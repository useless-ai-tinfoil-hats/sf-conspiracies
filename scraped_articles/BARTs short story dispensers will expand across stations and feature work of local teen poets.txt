BARTâ€™s short story dispensers will expand across stations and feature work of local, teen poets
-----
At select BART stations, kiosks offer riders a literary invitation. Bart goers can press a button to read an array of short stories: a one minute read, three minute read or a local short story contest winner's story. The machine will then dispense the story, receipt style.After three years, more than 38,000 stories have been dispensed and the program is expanding, according to BART officials.
BART is now calling on the Bay Area's teens to add their poetry to the kiosks.
