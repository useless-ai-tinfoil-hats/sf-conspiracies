Concerns ease as No. 15 Stanford women steamroll No. 9 Indiana
-----
The Stanford and Indiana women's basketball teams have been intertwined since Hoosiers alum Tara VanDerveer took over the Cardinal program in 1985, but there are more connections between their modern squads.Stanford and Indiana were No. 1 seeds in last year's NCAA Tournament and were upset in the second round. Both then lost key players to the WNBA: Haley Jones from Stanford and Grace Berger from Indiana.
But that's where the connections ended Sunday as No. 15 Stanford crushed No.
