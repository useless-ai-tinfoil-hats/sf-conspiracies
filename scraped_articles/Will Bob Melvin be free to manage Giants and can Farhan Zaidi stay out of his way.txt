Will Bob Melvin be free to manage Giants, and can Farhan Zaidi stay out of his way?
-----
Don't panic, San Francisco Giants fans.When new manager Bob Melvin has all 68 of his spring training roster players line up for the national anthem before each game, the purpose is to show team unity, not to make sure there are at least 50 pinch-hitters available for in-game, analytics-driven maneuverings.
This season, Melvin and president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi assure everyone, will be different. The manager will manage.
Yeah? Well, not everyone is assured.
