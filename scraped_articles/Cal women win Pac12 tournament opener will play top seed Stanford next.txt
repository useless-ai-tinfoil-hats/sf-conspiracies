Cal women win Pac-12 tournament opener, will play top seed Stanford next
-----
LAS VEGAS â€” It easily could have been deja vu all over again for Cal, with a secure lead in the first half against Washington State in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.But this Cal team is oh, so different from the one that couldn't hang in the second half a year ago. This version of the Bears can close out games, and beat a team three times in a season. This team can overcome the years of mediocrity in which it was unable to get past the first round.
And, so, with a 65-44
