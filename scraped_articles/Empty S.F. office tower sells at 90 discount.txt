Empty S.F. office tower sells at 90% discount
-----
Deeply discounted office towers have become the norm in San Francisco over the past year, but no recent deal has been as radical as one that closed in the city's struggling Mid-Market neighborhood this month: An empty 16-story tower traded for just $6.5 million.The $72 per square foot pricing for the tower at 995 Market St., which anchors the corner at 6th and Market streets, represents a 90% drop in value from when the building last sold in 2016, for roughly $62 million.
