Rattlesnake advisory issued for Bay Area parks as the reptiles become 'more active'
-----
The East Bay Regional Park District has issued a rattlesnake advisory for inland parts of the Bay Area, and with temperatures expected to increase as much as 40 degrees throughout the region in the coming days, sightings are even more likely as the slithering reptiles emerge from their winter hibernation and bask in the heat."Rattlesnakes are more active in warm weather, which can lead to more encounters with humans and dogs, especially along trails and roads," the news release read.
