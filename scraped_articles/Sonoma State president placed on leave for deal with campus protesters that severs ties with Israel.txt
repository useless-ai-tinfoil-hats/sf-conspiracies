Sonoma State president placed on leave for deal with campus protesters that severs ties with Israel
-----
Sonoma State University President Mike Lee is on administrative leave after unilaterally announcing terms of an agreement with pro-Palestinian student protesters this week that promised to terminate academic exchanges or research collaborations with Israel.Lee's message "was sent without the appropriate approvals" and amounted to "insubordination," Mildred Garcia, chancellor of the California State University system, said Wednesday in a statement.
