UC regents set to approve controversial plan to limit political speech on university websites
-----
In an effort to calm political divisions within the University of California and emphasize academic values, the regents are expected to vote Thursday to prohibit employees from posting personal views on prominent campus webpages.Such postings wouldn't be entirely outlawed. But they could show up only on secondary pages and would have to make clear that the views expressed were not the university's official position. Faculty with individual university websites wouldn't need a disclaimer
