The Chronicleâ€™s new food critic is here. Meet MacKenzie Chung Fegan
-----
(gently taps mic)Hi, I'm new here. "Here" being this newsletter, the San Francisco Chronicle and the city itself, although I did spend the first 18 years of my life in the South Bay. As the lead restaurant critic, I'll be taking the baton from Soleil Ho (picture us as teammates in a food writer relay race, sprinting with a foil-wrapped burrito in hand) and joining my colleague Cesar Hernandez in dishing about all there is to eat in the Bay Area.
