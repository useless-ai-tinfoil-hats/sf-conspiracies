Holidays are better with football. This year the 49ers have a rare trifecta
-----
Dec. 25, 1993, was a festive day for San Francisco Chronicle headline writers, even if it wasn't a good game for the San Francisco 49ers."Coal in 49ers' Stocking" and "Oilers Wrap Up 49ers" described a 10-7 loss to the Houston Oilers, in which quarterback Steve Young threw two interceptions in the end zone â€” and was pulled for backup Steve Bono.
But for me, it's a core holiday memory: traveling on a SamTrans bus filled with holiday joy; Candlestick Park looking like one big present
