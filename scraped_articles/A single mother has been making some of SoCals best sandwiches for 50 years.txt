A single mother has been making some of SoCal’s best sandwiches for 50 years
-----
Space is at a premium at DeFranko's Submarines. The tiny, nearly 50-year-old sandwich shop is a squat rectangle measuring no more than 10 feet across and 18 feet deep. It's all but impossible to have more than a dozen people inside at a time — and that includes five stools set into the floor for hungry customers.Out of a need for efficiency, everything happens fast here. Customers stand shoulder to shoulder during the lunch rush, calling out orders for turkey or ham and cheese subs. Bags
