Steve Garvey’s “Seinfeld”-esque campaign strategy: Do nothing, and hope to succeed
-----
Steve Garvey's Senate primary campaign was the political version of "Seinfeld": It was a campaign about nothing that was highly successful.Don't expect Garvey's strategy to change now that the Republican former Los Angeles Dodger star will face Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff in November. Except that now, the Schiff-friendly political action committee that boosted Garvey with $10 million of free advertising in the primary is going to shift gears and try to crush him.
