His parents kept falling. So this Bay Area engineer invented a ‘people picker-upper’
-----
Steve Powell had a problem — one common to many people with older relatives. His mother and father kept falling down.His divorced parents, who both wanted to age at home, lived separately near Powell's Livermore home. They'd call him, and he'd go over and get them back on their feet.
Once he wasn't available. His mom had to call 911 and felt humiliated in her nightgown in front of four burly firefighters.
His dad started falling more frequently, and became too weak for Powell
