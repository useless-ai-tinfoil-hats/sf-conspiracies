What in the world happened to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
-----
Curb your enthusiasm for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Hot take: He's the next Donald J. Trump, but even less politically accomplished and I didn't think that was possible.
The notion that RFK Jr. could competently serve as president of the United States is laughable. His TV star wife, actress Cheryl Hines, who plays Larry David's long-suffering spouse in "Curb Your Enthusiasm," seems superhuman in her tolerance for her real-life husband. Write in Larry, folks.
As a young man, RFK Jr.
