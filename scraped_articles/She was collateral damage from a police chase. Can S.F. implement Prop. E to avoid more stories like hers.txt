On the afternoon of Dec. 7, Ciara Keegan left her job in the East Bay and began the drive home to San Francisco. She was talking to her boyfriend on her car's speakerphone, making dinner plans, when she saw a black Nissan Infiniti heading straight for her. The car skidded out of its lane and hit her Honda CRV head-on.The impact was terrifying. Images posted on social media by a passerby showed the remains of the two cars, with wreckage spread across the road, glass and debris everywhere.
