Nicole Kidman just got an AFI Life Achievement Award. Are they kidding?
-----
There was a time, back in the last decades of the 20th century, when the absolute highest movie honor anyone could win was the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.Winning an Oscar? Fine. That meant you were good once, or at least people at the time thought so. But winning the AFI meant that your work, in the words of the institute, "fundamentally advanced the art of film" and "stood the test of time." To win the AFI meant that your life work made a difference and was forever.
