-----
California's status as one of the most expensive housing markets in the country has delayed homeownership for many residents. But there wasn't always such a vast difference between California and other states.In 2021, less than 45% of California residents were homeowners, according to a report published this year by the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation, down from nearly half in 2000. Nearly 60% of people in the United States owned a home in 2021.
