Join Total SF to hike the Crosstown Trailâ€™s new route
-----
When I think of the best of San Francisco I think of the Crosstown Trail.The trail is a tribute to grassroots activism, created by retired teacher Bob Siegel and a band of citizens, who bypassed government bureaucracy, fundraised and worked the trails by hand; built an easy-to-navigate website and launched the trail in 18 months.
The original hike starts at Candlestick Point and winds through the city to Lands End, but earlier this year, organizers revealed a second 14-mile route
