I climbed Japan's iconic Mt. Fuji â€” and left the mountain both a badass and a fool
-----
I was sitting on the steep slope of volcanic stone and sand, my right ankle swelled up to three times its normal size, looking out at a layer of clouds and green forest below, and for the first time since I set foot on Mount Fuji, I felt calm.My journey to that spot had started several months earlier when I signed up to climb Japan's tallest peak. I'm not a mountain climber and I'm not particularly fond of hiking, so the decision to do so at age 59 was somewhat hard to explain.
