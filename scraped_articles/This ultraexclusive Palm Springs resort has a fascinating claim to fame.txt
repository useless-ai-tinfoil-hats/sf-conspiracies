This ultraexclusive Palm Springs resort has a fascinating claim to fame
-----
I had made my reservation and prepaid for my stay. Still, I was nervous driving up to the gates that keep the ultraprivate ranch resort away from the rest of Palm Springs â€” and, by extension, away from any lookie-loos curious about what happens in that particular corner of the desert.I pulled up. I gave the guard my name. And as if by magic, the gates opened up.
I had arrived at Smoke Tree Ranch.
It's the kind of place that prefers to stay completely off the radar. Smoke Tree
