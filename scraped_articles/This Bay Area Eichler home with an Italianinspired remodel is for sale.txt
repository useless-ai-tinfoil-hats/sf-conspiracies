-----
People who own Eichler homes often go to great lengths to preserve them. Even when modernized, most remodels stay close to the original intent of the iconic American midcentury modern design. But that's not the case for 127 Camellia Ave. in Redwood City. This Eichler has been dramatically remodeled to have a totally different look and feel, and it's for sale now at $2.7 million.The current version of the 1950 home has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and 1,817 square feet of living space.
