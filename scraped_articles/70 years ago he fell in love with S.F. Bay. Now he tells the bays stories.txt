Now he roams the bay looking for stories.Herz fell in love with San Francisco Bay from the time he first set eyes on its waters more than 70 years ago. He saw the bay as the centerpiece of the region and the cities that had grown up around it. San Francisco Bay affects everything from the region's commerce to its weather.
