Juneteenth 2024: Embrace themes of Black joy and freedom with community celebrations in the Bay Area

In 1863, President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was enacted, marking the official end of slavery in the United States. However, it took nearly two years for the news to be communicated to all states. Reportedly, it was finally read to enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, which is why Juneteenth is observed each year on this date. The occasion became an official Federal holiday when, on June 17, 2021, President Biden signed it into law.The San Francisco Juneteenth
