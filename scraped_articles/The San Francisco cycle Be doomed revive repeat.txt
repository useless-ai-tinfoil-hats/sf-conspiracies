The San Francisco cycle: Be doomed, revive, repeat
-----
In the spring of 1968, in South Ozone Park, it became popular to use the word "snag."When Dennis McCormick broke a window, or Brother X got in trouble with the Little Sisters of the Gestapo (as he called them), or I tripped over my shoelaces, you'd hear one of the boys yell, "SNAG!" A snag is an unexpected obstacle, so although the word may have been literally true, it had a pejorative feeling, as if whenever I tripped, this was earned misfortune, like I had invoked the wrath of the gods
