With Kyle Harrison headed to IL, Giants call up baseball globetrotter Spencer Bivens
-----
Spencer Bivens might have felt the fatigue Sunday morning if his first day in the major leagues with the San Francisco Giants wasn't in the afternoon. He arrived in San Francisco at 3 a.m. â€” and at Oracle Park a few hours later."The past few hours have been like an absolute hurricane," the 29-year-old right-hander said Sunday morning through a smile in the Giants clubhouse. "I haven't had much sleep. But I don't see that being a problem today."
Bivens, 29, reached the majors
