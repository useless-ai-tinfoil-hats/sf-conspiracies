Disneyland quietly opens a new restaurant in the Disneyland Hotel
-----
For years, the space sat vacant, part of Disneyland's "phased reopening" that never actually reopened. And then, without fanfare, The Lounge at the Disneyland Hotel hosted its first guests Thursday.The space is so new that it doesn't even have a listing on the Disneyland website yet, and you can't find the menu online. It's furnished with a collection of couches and armchairs and has a dozen or so seats at the bar. The drinks are classic cocktails â€” think martinis, Hemingway daiquiris
