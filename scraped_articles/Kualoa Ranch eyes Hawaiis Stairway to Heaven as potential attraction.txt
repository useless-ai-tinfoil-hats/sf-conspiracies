Kualoa Ranch eyes Hawaii's 'Stairway to Heaven' as potential attraction
-----
On the island of Oahu, one of Hawaii's most contentious issues has long been about what to do with the Haiku Stairs â€” a metal staircase also known as the "Stairway to Heaven" that rises 3,922 steps up the Koolau Range to a height of 2,800 feet.Hiking the stairs is illegal, but hikers trespassing over private property to gain access to the stairs have caused problems for area residents, heightening concerns. In 2021, the Honolulu City Council voted unanimously to have the stairs removed.
