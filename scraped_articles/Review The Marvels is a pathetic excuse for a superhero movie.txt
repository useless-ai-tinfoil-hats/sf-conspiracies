Review: ‘The Marvels’ is a pathetic excuse for a superhero movie
-----
Captain Marvel is a drippy, weepy, pathetic excuse for a superhero. When she's not flying through space and repairing damaged solar systems, she goes through life acting diffident, feeling guilty and getting teary-eyed in every encounter.She has a lot to be emotional about in "The Marvels," because this time she's reunited with Monica Rambeau, the child she promised to look out for in "Captain Marvel." The last time we saw her she was 11. But Monica is growing up fast — amazingly fast.
