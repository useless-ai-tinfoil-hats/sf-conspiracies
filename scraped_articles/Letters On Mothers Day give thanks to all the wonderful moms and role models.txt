Letters: On Motherâ€™s Day, give thanks to all the wonderful moms and role models
-----
I am grateful for all the wise, smart, strong, loving and crazy women in my life.You all collectively modeled for me how best to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother, a grandmother and a friend. I witnessed your acts of kindness to those in need and your faith in the goodness of life.
You taught me, through example, how a woman can be a positive force in the lives of all the people around her by seeing each person as their mother sees them. With love and acceptance.
I
