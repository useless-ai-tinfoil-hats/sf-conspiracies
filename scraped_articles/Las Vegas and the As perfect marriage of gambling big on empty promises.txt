Las Vegas and the Aâ€™s perfect marriage of gambling big on empty promises
-----
As Max Verstappen took the checkered flag waved by Justin Bieber on Sunday, winning the first Las Vegas Grand Prix, the Dutch Formula 1 driver belted an off-key snippet of "Viva Las Vegas" into his team radio.That seemed odd, considering that Verstappen had been the biggest critic of the Vegas event, calling it "99% show and 1% sporting event." The driver later sheepishly explained that his team owner prompted him to become an instant karaoke Elvis.
