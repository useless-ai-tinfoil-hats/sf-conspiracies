Giants honor Willie Mays in touching tribute at Oracle Park: ‘He was our guy’
-----
They gathered at the Willie Mays statue and left flowers. They dropped by the Willie Mays popup exhibit to soak in the vibes. They entered Oracle Park at Willie Mays Plaza to catch a pregame tribute that honored a hero.They were San Francisco Giants fans and/or Willie Mays fans. Some weren't fans at all, but all came with the same purpose. To pay their respects, toast a legend and try to find a fine line between celebrating and mourning.
The Giants were back in town Monday night
