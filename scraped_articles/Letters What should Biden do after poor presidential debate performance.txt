Letters: What should Biden do after poor presidential debate performance?
-----
Clean slatePresident Joe Biden's debate performance was an unmitigated disaster. His incoherence obliterated any message he wanted to get across. All he had to do was appear vibrant and engaged, a low bar that he failed to clear.
The damage appears irreparable. Four years ago Biden, a decent person with character and integrity, was the only person who could have beaten a charlatan like Donald Trump. Now, he is likely one of the only people who could lose to him.
For the good
