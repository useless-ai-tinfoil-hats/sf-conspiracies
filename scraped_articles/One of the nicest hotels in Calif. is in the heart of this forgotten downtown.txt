One of the nicest hotels in Calif. is in the heart of this forgotten downtown
-----
The Padre Hotel in Bakersfield is comfortable, haunted and historic. It's positioned perfectly in the center of a downtown that's starting to show signs, both big and small, of coming back to life. In other words, it's all of those things you want in a hotel.But most of all, it's nice.
It's a nice place to meet for a drink, or several drinks. It's a nice spot to recommend to family or friends who are coming from out of town. It's nice to have a staycation there if you just want to
