Breweries have become overrun with babies. Sorry, internet, get used to it
-----
Of all the things that are riling people up this week, the presence of children at breweries has ignited a unique sort of dispute."STOP BRINGING YOUR KIDS TO BREWERIES IM TRYING TO RELAX," wrote @tapptastical on X in a post that, as I'm writing, has been viewed 3.4 million times.
Predictably, the internet had some thoughts. "I'm going to bring my kids to breweries even harder now," responded @Ephon. Another user, @RolyBenitez, pointed out the obvious: "Who relaxes at a brewery"?
