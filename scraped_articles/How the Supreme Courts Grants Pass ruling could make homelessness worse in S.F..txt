How the Supreme Courtâ€™s Grants Pass ruling could make homelessness worse in S.F.
-----
On Friday, after two months of deliberation, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion, ruled that Grants Pass, Ore., a town with a population of 40,000 and about 600 homeless residents, is legally allowed to cite people who sleep outdoors on public property, even when there is no shelter space available.The ruling overturns Martin v. Boise, which required cities to provide a "reasonable" offer of shelter before enforcing anti-camping ordinances.
