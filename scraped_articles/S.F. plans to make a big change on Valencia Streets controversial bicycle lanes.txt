S.F. plans to make a big change on Valencia Streetâ€™s controversial bicycle lanes
-----
San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency appears ready to shift course on its much-criticized center-running bikeway project on Valencia Street.The agency's staff will ask the city's transportation board at its June 18 meeting to approve a conceptual design for a side-running bikeway to replace the Valencia corridor's center-running bikeway, according to a public-hearing notice. The current center lanes span eight blocks on Valencia between 15th and 23rd streets.
