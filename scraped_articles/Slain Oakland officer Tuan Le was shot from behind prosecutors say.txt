Slain Oakland officer Tuan Le was shot from behind, prosecutors say
-----
The shots came from behind Oakland police officer Tuan Le and his partner â€” from a car trailing the undercover investigators as they followed suspects in a burglary at a marijuana grow house in late December.Le, who was in the driver's seat of the officers' unmarked pickup, was struck in the head and died.
This week, officer Donald McKinney, who was in the passenger seat next to Le, recounted the shooting during a preliminary hearing for four men charged with murder in Le's death.
