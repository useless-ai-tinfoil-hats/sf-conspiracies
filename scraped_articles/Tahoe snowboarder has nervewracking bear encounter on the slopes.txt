Tahoe snowboarder has nerve-wracking bear encounter on the slopes
-----
The last run of the day up in Lake Tahoe was especially memorable for Danielle Brill last Friday. The Sacramento snowboarder, who was enjoying fresh snow and blue skies at Heavenly Valley, was heading down the Mombo run around 3:30 p.m. when a bear appeared in front of her on the slopes.Brill stopped in her tracks but, instead of just freezing up, she took out her camera to videotape the encounter.
"Oh my God," she can be heard saying while breathing heavily and holding her camera
