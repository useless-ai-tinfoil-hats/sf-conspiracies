Giantsâ€™ Alex Cobb grinds it out in 10-inning win; Sabol, Wade cap it
-----
Alex Cobb was not right. He walked gingerly around the mound. He stretched and bent his body in all kinds of different ways. He rubbed his hip. He grimaced. He looked uneasy and uncomfortable. Yet, he knew what was at stake and persevered.Every inning, the San Francisco Giants pitcher walked onto the Oracle Park field knowing he was far from healthy, his hip impingement preventing him from feeling like his normal self.
With the Giants still in the wild-card race following a sweep
