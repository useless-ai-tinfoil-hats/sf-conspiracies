An Italian restaurant in North Beach that for more than 50 years has carried on the neighborhood's name and earned a reputation as an iconic gathering place for generations of San Franciscans, politicians, artists and executives is preparing to wind down operations.The decision comes just two years after North Beach Restaurant at 1512 Stockton St. survived a prolonged pandemic-induced closure. It has been struggling ever since to recover.
