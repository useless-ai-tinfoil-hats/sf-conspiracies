This deserted cove away from civilization in Marin County refreshes the soul
-----
Three of us landed on the small empty beach like explorers. We were only a few miles from the Golden Gate but the pretty cove was deserted. There was not a footprint in the sand, not a soul in sight, only birds and a seal. It was as if no one had ever been there.The place is called White Gulch, an inlet on the western side of Tomales Bay in Marin County. My pals, Richard Everett and his son, Carson, took me there in their 13-foot Boston Whaler boat, on a bumpy 15 minute ride over the bay
