For Lincoln and Balboa, football has become Thanksgivingâ€™s main course
-----
There's a picture of Kezar Stadium from the 1940s hanging prominently in the home office of Lincoln coach Phil Ferrigno. It was taken by his grandfather from UCSF hospital, which overlooks the historic athletic facility that sits on the southeast corner of Golden Gate Park and housed the 49ers from 1946 to 1970."My wife found the photo and blew it up," Ferrigno said. "It definitely has a special meaning. I never thought I'd be doing this every Thanksgiving. I'm very grateful."
