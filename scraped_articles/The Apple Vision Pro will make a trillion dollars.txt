The Apple Vision Pro will make a trillion dollars
-----
It never pays to be an early adopter. There was a time when every Apple nerd on Earth would stand in line for hours on end just for the privilege of throwing down hundreds of dollars on whatever slightly improved iPhone camera Steve Jobs deigned to bequeath them. But the majority of us know better now that the first version of any tech product like the Apple Vision Pro is a rough draft that will age as well as a banana left out in the sun. It pays, often literally, to wait for these companies
