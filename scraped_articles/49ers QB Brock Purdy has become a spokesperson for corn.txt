49ers QB Brock Purdy has become a spokesperson for corn
-----
49ers star Brock Purdy was born and raised in the Phoenix suburbs and now plays in San Francisco. But the quarterback's four-year stint at Iowa State is helping him pick up some unique sponsorship deals.On Wednesday, Iowa-based agricultural company Pioneer Seeds announced that Purdy had "joined the team roster" as a pitchman. The commercial comes six weeks after Purdy was spotted on a massive John Deere tractor in San Francisco, presumably for his new sponsorship deal with that company.
