Iconic, Award-Winning ‘Surf House’ in Santa Cruz on the Market for the First Time
-----
(ad) Surf House sits at the edge of one of the most beautiful, wild, and biologically diverse treasures in the world — the Monterey Bay. Designed by Feldman Architecture and Commune Design, the home fits into the coastline as if created by nature's hand. Lovingly crafted from reclaimed and repurposed Monterey Cypress, the refined elegance of this two-story, 4,490-square-foot home reflects the natural world, and the culture and values of the world-renowned neighborhood in which it resides.
