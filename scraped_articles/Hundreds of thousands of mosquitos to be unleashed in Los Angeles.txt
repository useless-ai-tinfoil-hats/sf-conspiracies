Hundreds of thousands of mosquitos to be unleashed in Los Angeles
-----
If you live in Los Angeles and start seeing people releasing fluorescent-colored mosquitos from plastic buckets, you're not hallucinating.But there is a good reason for releasing these bugs. According to an April 12 news release from the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District, it's all part of a coordinated plan to wage war on the invasive Aedes aegypti mosquito, an aggressive vector that rightfully earned its "ankle biter" nickname.
