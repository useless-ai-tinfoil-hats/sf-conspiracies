A ‘lucid nightmare’: Historic Marin boat shack destroyed in fire
-----
When flames on Sunday engulfed the historic boat shack at the popular Nick's Cove hotel and restaurant in Marshall, on the Tomales Bay waterfront in Marin County, the restaurant's managing partner, Benson Wang, grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran toward the smoke.At the pier, a volunteer firefighter kept him from approaching the fire, which had become too large and unsafe to engage.
They watched the blaze overtake the building in minutes. The structure was unoccupied at the time.
