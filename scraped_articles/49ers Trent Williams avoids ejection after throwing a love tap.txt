49ers’ Trent Williams avoids ejection after throwing a ‘love tap’
-----
Trent Williams smiled when asked about an incident that happened just before halftime Thursday night."I don't remember," the San Francisco 49ers' left tackle said. "That was a long time ago."
Williams' memory could be jogged next week when he receives a fine from the NFL. On what appeared to be the final snap of the second quarter in the 49ers' 30-12 win over the Giants, Williams punched defensive tackle A'Shawn Robinson in the facemask after quarterback Brock Purdy took a knee.
