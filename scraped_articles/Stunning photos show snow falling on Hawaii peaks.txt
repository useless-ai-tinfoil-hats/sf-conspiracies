Stunning photos show snow falling on Hawaii peaks
-----
The snow season is upon us, with eager ski lovers hitting the road for Lake Tahoe's famed slopes. But snow also fell on another beloved vacation locale, one less known for fresh powder: Hawaii's Big Island.Snow dumped on Hawaii's Maunakea and Mauna Loa, with several inches recorded on these peaks, which both reach nearly 14,000 feet in elevation.
The snow was delivered by a Kona low, a type of subtropical cyclone that commonly sweeps across the islands in November.
