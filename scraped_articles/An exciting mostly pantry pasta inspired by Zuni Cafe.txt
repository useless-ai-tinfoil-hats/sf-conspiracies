An exciting, mostly pantry pasta inspired by Zuni Cafe

Ah, cauliflower, it's such a gentle vegetable. Being gentle and mild-flavored does not mean you can't be royalty, though.Sure, a creamy cauliflower gratin can be delicious and soothing, but I also like to contrast this vegetable with some spice, some zest, ingredients with oomph. Strong sidekicks can make cauliflower the crowning queen of the brassicas â€” atop the throne at any dinner table.
One of my favorite ways to serve cauliflower is a simple, almost all-pantry staple meal
