Police arrested three people Thursday in connection with burglaries around the Oakland-Alameda estuary — the latest attempt to quell pirates who prowl the water in dinghies or drive along the shoreline roads, stealing from boats and docks.Officers from the Oakland Police Department's maritime unit and burglary detail said they served two search warrants on "separate, but associated" vessels Thursday afternoon after linking them to a March 13 break-in on the waterfront.
