'Dune: Part Two' review: Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya are back in smart but dull sci-fi
-----
"Dune: Part Two" is an intelligent, conscientious science fiction movie, but also something of a bore.Like French Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve's first "Dune," released in 2021, it successfully creates a completely realized other world. But that other world is repellent and resists a viewer's engagement. If you see "Dune: Part Two" without having seen "Dune," you will have absolutely no idea what's going on. In fact, you still might be confused if you haven't "Dune" in the last
