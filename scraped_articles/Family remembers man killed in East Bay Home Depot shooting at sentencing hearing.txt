Family remembers man killed in East Bay Home Depot shooting at sentencing hearing
-----
Lorie Mohs wishes she had made the call.It was a Tuesday in April 2023. She and her 26-year-old son usually caught up over the phone on Wednesdays, so she decided to wait.
But there was no call. Her son, Blake Mohs was fatally shot while working as a loss-prevention officer at a Home Depot in Pleasanton.
Lorie Mohs' decision, and the lack of a goodbye, "broke my heart," she said in court Thursday just before the two defendants in the fatal shooting of her son were sentenced.
