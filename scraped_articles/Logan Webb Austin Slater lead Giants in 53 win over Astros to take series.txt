Logan Webb, Austin Slater lead Giants in 5-3 win over Astros to take series
-----
Logan Webb had to tip his cap.His 1-0 changeup to Yordan Alvarez went exactly where he wanted it: well below the zone near the lefty slugger's shins. But Alvarez dug down and sliced through, sending it the opposite way 405 feet for a two-run home run.
"That's the first time I've seen a changeup underneath hit the other way. I was in awe as it happened," Webb said. "When he first hit it, I was like, 'No way,' and then it kept going."
The Houston Astros could only count on that
