He lobbied Gavin Newsom to veto historic caste law. Who is Ramesh Kapur?
-----
Hours before California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed landmark legislation to outlaw caste discrimination, Ramesh V. Kapur, a Massachusetts entrepreneur with deep ties to affluent Indian American donors, said Newsom personally emailed him to let him know it was about to happen."He (emailed) that he was going to veto it," Kapur told the Chronicle. "That's courtesy. That, to me, I looked at it as a good sign of the politician."
It was also a sign of Kapur's political reach.
