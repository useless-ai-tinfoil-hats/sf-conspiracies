Bay Area weather: Another chance of rain showers in these cities today
-----
A weak cold front Monday took aim at the North Bay and brought sprinkles to the Peninsula and inland parts of the Bay Area. Another weak cold front is on its heels Tuesday, this one even more moisture-starved than Monday.The front will approach the North Bay during the afternoon and move across the Peninsula by the early evening. Quick-hitting showers could drop a few hundredths of an inch of precipitation, but many areas will miss out. Northwest winds will increase behind the front
