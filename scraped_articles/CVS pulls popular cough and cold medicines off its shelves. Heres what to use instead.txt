CVS pulls popular cough and cold medicines off its shelves. Hereâ€™s what to use instead
-----
CVS Health said Friday that it will remove several popular cough and cold treatments from its shelves because they contain an ingredient that researchers now say works no better than a sugar pill to relieve nasal congestion.The move comes a month after advisers to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously voted against the effectiveness of phenylephrine, a decongestant found in versions of medications sold under brand names such as Sudafed, Benadryl, NyQuil, Advil and Tylenol.
