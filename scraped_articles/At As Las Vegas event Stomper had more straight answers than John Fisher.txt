At A’s Las Vegas event, Stomper had more straight answers than John Fisher
-----
LAS VEGAS — Sorry, Oakland Athletics fans, I bring you bad news from the future home of your once-beloved baseball club.A's owner John Fisher appeared Wednesday morning at a Chamber of Commerce event, "Preview Las Vegas." After listening to his brief lounge act, then tossing a few questions at him backstage, I can offer no hope that Fisher's Vegas plan will blow up and he will take another shot at Oakland.
The A's move to Vegas still seems like a half-baked plan, with more holes
