Multi-talented Charles Williams propels unbeaten Marin Catholic
-----
Charles Williams' nickname is unusual: IsoChuck, standing for isolation: that in one-on-one situations, he can't be beat.The 6-foot-1, 175-pound senior from Marin Catholic-Kentfield is both tough to tackle in the open field as a fleet and elusive tailback, or gain any separation — let alone haul in a pass — as a long and athletic cornerback.
"Last season I gave up one touchdown" as a cornerback, Williams said. "My goal this year was to give up none. So far, so good."
