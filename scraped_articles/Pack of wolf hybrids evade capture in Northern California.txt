Pack of wolf hybrids evade capture in Northern California
-----
Authorities are trying to capture a pack of wild "wolf-type" dogs that have been roaming the streets of Shingletown in Northern California since last week.The animals were described as likely "wolf/husky/malamute hybrids that belonged to a local resident and had gone feral," Tim Mapes, public information officer for the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, said in a news release Friday. Wolf hybrids are canines produced from the mating between a wolf and a domestic dog.
