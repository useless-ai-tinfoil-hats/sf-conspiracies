-----
The first meteor shower of the year is about to reach its peak over the Bay Area early Thursday morning, and the unique event is expected to produce as many as 120 "larger fireballs" than usual per hour over the night sky.The best time to view the Quadrantids will be at about 1 a.m., said Gerald McKeegan, adjunct astronomer for the Chabot Space & Science Center in Oakland. This shower is named for the defunct constellation Quadrans Muralis, which is now part of the constellation Bootes
