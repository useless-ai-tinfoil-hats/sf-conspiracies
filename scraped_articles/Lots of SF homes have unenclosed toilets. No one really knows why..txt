Lots of SF homes have unenclosed toilets. No one really knows why.
-----
A single white porcelain toilet sits in the middle of an unfinished lower level of a San Francisco house. There are no walls around it and no nearby sink. It's just there â€” daring you to remove it, or perhaps even more daringly, use it.These lonely toilets are another example of the city's home oddities, even if they may be a bit more jarring than a strange cabinet or mysterious singing windows. The story behind them is likely rooted in pure practicality, though many theories abound.
