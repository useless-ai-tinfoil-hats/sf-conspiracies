Photo: Ultra-rare animal spotted at Point Reyes National Seashore
-----
A rare American Badger with leucism — a condition marked by a partial loss of pigmentation — was recently spotted and photographed at Point Reyes National Seashore, officials with the National Parks Service said this week.A photo of the cream-colored creature posted to the Point Reyes park's Facebook page that showed the badger trundling down a path included an explanation of leucism.
One giveaway: Unlike animals with albinism, the badger's eyes appear brown or black, not pink.
