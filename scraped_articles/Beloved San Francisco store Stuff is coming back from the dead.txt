Beloved San Francisco store, Stuff, is coming back from the dead
-----
San Franciscans were heartbroken when the iconic vintage furniture, art and clothing store Stuff closed the doors of its neon orange emporium in February after 13 years in operation.But the store's legacy quickly spurred a renaissance: Two new iterations of the shop, each spearheaded by former vendors, are popping up in the Bay Area. Stuff East Bay opened on March 1, and Stuff by Luxe is set to launch in San Francisco on March 16.
