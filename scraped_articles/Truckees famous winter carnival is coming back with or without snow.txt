Truckee's famous winter carnival is coming back, with or without snow
-----
Though it may be hard to believe now, in the late 1800s, Lake Tahoe barely had any tourists. And that was especially true in the winter, in the days long before ski resorts, casinos and luxury hotels.That's why, in 1894, one enterprising Truckee resident came up with a lofty idea to bring tourists to town by creating inexpensive winter recreation near the train station. He spearheaded the construction of a 50-foot-tall ice palace, one so wide that it blocked the town's main intersection.
