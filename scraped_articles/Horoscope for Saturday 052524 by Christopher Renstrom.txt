Horoscope for Saturday, 05/25/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Get used to juggling different projects at the same time and don't worry about scattering your creative energies. This will actually focus them.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Addressing a matter before you have a solution is asking for trouble. Demur for now until you can come up with a game plan.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): You love change, but adventurous Jupiter may bring more than even you can handle. Get ready to go where no Gemini has gone before!
