Behold Snowshoe Thompson, Tahoe's wolf-fighting, skiing mailman

About 40 minutes south of South Lake Tahoe, in the town of Markleeville, there's a fairly nondescript parking area on the shoulder of state Route 88. It's easy to miss, as is the actual start of the trail from the parking area. At just a 0.7-mile round trip, it's easy to cover in 30 minutes, even accounting for the 230 or so feet of elevation gain up steep stone steps.It'd be easy to wonder why the short trail even exists in the first place. At the turn-around point is a boulder pile
