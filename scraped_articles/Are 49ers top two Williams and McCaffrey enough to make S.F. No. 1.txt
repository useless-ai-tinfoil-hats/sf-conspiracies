Are 49ers’ top two, Williams and McCaffrey, enough to make S.F. No. 1?

LAS VEGAS — Here at Super Bowl week, hype and hyperbole pile up like chips on the dealer's side of the table, but hear me out.Is it possible that San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle Trent Williams and running back Christian McCaffrey, in no particular order, are the two best players in football?
McCaffrey won the league rushing title this season by a margin so wide it's silly. Also catches a ton of passes and sparks the most explosive offense in the NFL. Fullback Kyle Juszczyk
