Our critic does the Oscars calculus on what film wins best picture
-----
Guessing which movie will win the Oscar for best picture used to be easy. The prize usually went to the biggest movie, and if more than one movie was big, then it went to the biggest, stupidest movie.Classic example: In 1996, "Apollo 13" was up against "Braveheart." Both big movies, but somehow Mel Gibson with hair extensions seemed a lot more ridiculous than Tom Hanks saying "Houston, we have a problem," and so "Braveheart" won.
