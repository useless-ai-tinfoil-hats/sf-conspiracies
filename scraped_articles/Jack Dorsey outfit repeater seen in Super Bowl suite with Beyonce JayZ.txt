-----
For the second year in a row, a rather prominent Bay Area executive shared a Super Bowl luxury suite with hip-hop power couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z — and he was wearing the exact same outfit he wore to last year's game.Jack Dorsey, the founder and current head of Block (formerly Square) and the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter (now X), was spotted in the luxury suite by CBS but not mentioned, even though he was sitting directly next to Beyoncé and right in front of Jay-Z.
