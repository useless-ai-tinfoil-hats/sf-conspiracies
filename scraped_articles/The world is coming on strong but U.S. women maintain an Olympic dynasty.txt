The world is coming on strong, but U.S. women maintain an Olympic dynasty
-----
PARIS — When the ball slipped through the net at the final buzzer, the arena — perhaps all of France — gasped. The players held their collective breath. The French coach raised two fingers in question.Oui.
Gabby Williams' toe was clearly inside the three-point arc. The former UConn player's buzzer shot was a two-pointer. France had lost to the mighty U.S. women's basketball team by one point. One inch. A sneaker toe.
And so the greatest dynasty in Olympic history survives.
