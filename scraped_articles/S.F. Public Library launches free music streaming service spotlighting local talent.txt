The San Francisco Public Library is inviting patrons to raise their voices to celebrate the launch of its new free music streaming service, "Bay Beats."The debut of the new feature will be marked with an event at the Main Library on Saturday, Oct. 28, featuring a diverse lineup of participating artists.
