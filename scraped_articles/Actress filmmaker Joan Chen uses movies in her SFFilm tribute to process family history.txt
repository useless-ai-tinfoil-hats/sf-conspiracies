Actress, filmmaker Joan Chen uses movies in her SFFilm tribute to process family history
-----
Joan Chen has lived in San Francisco for more than 30 years — longer than her native Shanghai — but the Bay Area still holds many surprises for the actress and filmmaker."I've lived here forever and never been to Fremont," Chen said during a recent conversation with the Chronicle. "I discovered all these wonderful boba teahouses, Asian restaurants and Asian markets. It's actually a very wonderful suburb."
Fremont is also, suddenly, the center of the Bay Area filmmaking universe.
