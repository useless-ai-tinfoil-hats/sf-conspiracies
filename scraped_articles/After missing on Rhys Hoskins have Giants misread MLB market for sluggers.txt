After missing on Rhys Hoskins, have Giants misread MLB market for sluggers?
-----
For all of baseball's changes the past few years, home runs still rule. Power plays. And the San Francisco Giants don't have enough of it.The Giants made a minor run at Rhys Hoskins, the former Phillies slugger from Sacramento, but the offer wasn't close to Milwaukee's, according to industry sources. Hoskins agreed to a two-year, $34 million deal with the Brewers. That includes an opt-out after the first year, something the Giants are trying to avoid after agreeing to numerous such deals
