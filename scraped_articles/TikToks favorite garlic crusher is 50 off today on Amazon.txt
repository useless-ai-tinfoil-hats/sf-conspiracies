I'm obsessed with finding everyday products that spark joy. The objects you use every day need to be functional, yes, but what if they could also inject a little delight into otherwise run-of-the-mill tasks? That's where OTOTO, the TikTok-loved kitchen and home goods brand, comes in. Today, their beloved garlic crusher, aptly named Gracula, is on sale for 50% off.OTOTO Gracula Garlic Crusher - $14.95 (50% off; originally $29.95)
This punny kitchen tool actually works well, too.
