Mountainous Sierra highway reopens for Yosemite travelers
-----
If the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil is a pseudoscientific indicator for the winter season, then perhaps the opening of a major road through Yosemite is the sign that summer is upon us. Yosemite National Park announced over the weekend that Tioga Road, a barometer to show when winter conditions are over, is open to drivers on June 10."We are so excited to welcome visitors and staff back to the high country of Tuolumne Meadows," the park wrote in the post.
