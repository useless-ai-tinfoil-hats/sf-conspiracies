Bruce Springsteen signs note at S.F. concert excusing young fan from school
-----
Bruce Springsteen did a young fan a huge favor during his San Francisco concert on Easter Sunday.Anticipating that the sold-out three-hour-plus show at Chase Center would run late into the night, making it difficult to wake up early the next day, the audience member showed up with a hand-made sign that read, "Skipping school, sign my note?"
A video shared on Facebook by Karen Pitcher Scovell, who was standing near the young fan, showed Springsteen happily fulfilling the request.
