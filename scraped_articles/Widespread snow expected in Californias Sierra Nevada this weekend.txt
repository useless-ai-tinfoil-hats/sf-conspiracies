Widespread snow expected in California's Sierra Nevada this weekend
-----
Spring may be here, but winter is not over in California's Sierra Nevada.An area of low pressure is expected to sweep the Golden State Friday through Sunday, bringing about 1 foot of fresh powder to higher elevations of the Sierra, said meteorologist Bob Oravec with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.
The storm is predicted to bring more snow to the Central Sierra, including Yosemite National Park and the Mammoth area, than the northern and southern sections.
