Warmer weather to return to bay shore Thursday. Hereâ€™s how long it will last
-----
After a few days of drizzly, cool weather, warmer temperatures are expected to make a brief return to the bay shore on Thursday.Light offshore winds in the morning will hold off the sea breeze until later in the afternoon. This will allow afternoon temperatures in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley to climb to the mid-70s, about 5 degrees above normal for the date. Inland areas will be closer to normal, in the upper 70s to lower 80s, while the immediate coast tops out in the upper 60s.
