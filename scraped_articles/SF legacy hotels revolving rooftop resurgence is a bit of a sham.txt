SF legacy hotel's revolving rooftop resurgence is a bit of a sham
-----
The Hyatt Regency San Francisco's once-famed revolving restaurant is in fact spinning again â€” but not for you and me.The historic Embarcadero hotel made headlines last month when engineers repaired the floor of its former revolving rooftop restaurant, the Equinox, to once again rotate. The restaurant, which shuttered in 2007, was known for making a slow, 56-minute turn that offered diners glorious 360-degree views of the city and the bay, according to a press release sent to SFGATE.
