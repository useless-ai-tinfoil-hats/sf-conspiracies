Hawaii is trying to kill me
-----
As a meteorologist who reports on Earth science news, I call Hawaii home because of the multiple scientific processes that come together here every day to create a true paradise.The joke among locals in the Aloha State is that we live on an island that is actively trying to kill us. Hawaii will be a home for earthquakes, tsunamis, flash floods, hurricanes and volcanic eruptions for thousands of years to come. But the Aug. 8 wildfire tragedy on Maui has turned the joke on its head,
