SF ‘needs this place’: Owner of beloved 17-year-old store searching for buyer for the business

In retrospect, Giselle Gyalzen admits that taking over San Francisco store Rare Device without prior small business experience, and with a five-month old in tow, was a leap of faith. She's grateful she took that risk — "It's been such a fun ride, it's been amazing," she told SFGATE — but now, after 13 years, she's ready to move on.To that end, she's hoping to sell the Divisadero Street store. "I'm so excited to find the person or people to lead the next phase of Rare Device," she said.
