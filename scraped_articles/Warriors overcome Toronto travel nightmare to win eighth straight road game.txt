Warriors overcome Toronto travel nightmare to win eighth straight road game
-----
TORONTO — Their flight didn't depart from New York until 5 a.m. Friday, leaving the Golden State Warriors full of fatigue as they departed to Toronto for their second game in two nights. Their airplane had issues. They were stuck on the tarmac, arriving after 7 a.m. at their team hotel in Toronto.Naturally, they'd sleep a few more hours — and the first six minutes against the Toronto Raptors. In the words of Stephen Curry: "A very long night. A very long day."
A very fulfilling
