Mavericks lights up with surfers from around the globe chasing epic waves
-----
While many of the Bay Area's coastal and beach towns have faced flooding and evacuation orders this week because of swells from an El Ni√±o weather system, surfers descended on famous Mavericks Beach near Half Moon Bay to try and catch some of the waves.Surfing website Surfline estimated that some waves were as tall as 30 to 40 feet Thursday. Friday is expected to have a smaller breaking height before a new swell brings more 30-foot waves on Saturday and potentially again on Sunday,
