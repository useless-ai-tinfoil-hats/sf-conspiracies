Video: Here’s what the elaborate shack clinging to a Bay Area cliff looks like today
-----
An elaborate, three-story shack perched precariously on a San Mateo County cliff above the Pacific Ocean — possibly inhabited by a hermit and captured in a video that went viral last week — is in shambles.New video footage of the structure near Pacifica shot by the Chronicle shows the shack in an almost completely destroyed state, similar to how it looked in a photograph taken in January, but this time with the possibility that its occupant has built another abode nearby.
