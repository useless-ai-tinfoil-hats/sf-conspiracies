Fans’ plea to MLB? Keep A’s in Oakland. Just don’t let John Fisher benefit
-----
The city of Oakland is asking MLB to reject the Oakland Athletics' proposed move to Las Vegas.If that move falls apart and the A's come crawling back to America's most abused sports town, Oakland should say no to John Fisher. Not out of spite for the man who has mistreated the team and the town, but for self-protection and for the good of Oakland.
When hammering out a big business deal, you sometimes have to hold your nose.
But you never have to sell your soul.
The fine
