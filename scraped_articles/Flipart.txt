Flipart
-----
If the #OddlySatisfying TikTok trend became a puzzle, it would be Flipart. In our new game, you rotate colorful, differently shaped tiles until they all fit perfectly within the space with no overlaps. Like sliding your carry-on in the last open spot in the overhead bin or fitting all the plates perfectly in the dishwasher, Flipart activates the same part of your brain when every tile clicks into place. Very satisfying.
