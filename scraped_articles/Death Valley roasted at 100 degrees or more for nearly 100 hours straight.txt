Death Valley roasted at 100 degrees or more for nearly 100 hours straight
-----
Hot off a record-breaking July for average daily temperature, Death Valley National Park nearly broke another record for grueling heat when temperatures in the park remained 100 degrees or hotter for nearly 100 consecutive hours last week.While it's normal for temperatures to remain above 100 degrees at night in Death Valley during the summer, what stood out for Abby Wines, management analyst at Death Valley National Park, was how it didn't cool down across the span of nights.
