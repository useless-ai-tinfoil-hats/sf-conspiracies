Horoscope for Friday, 01/05/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): Refrain from criticism until an enterprise is safely past the starting gate. Looking for faults this early will only hinder progress.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): You don't like being told what to do, but are you truly ready to go your own way now? Bide your time and the cranky mood will pass.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Competitors may have the upper hand, but not for long. Their overconfidence and inattention to detail will trip them up soon.
