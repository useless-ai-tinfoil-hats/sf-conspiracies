Review: ‘The Persian Version’ is a muddled story of an Iranian American mother-daughter relationship
-----
"The Persian Version" is the work of a confident filmmaker, and the opening minutes ooze with the charm of someone absolutely sure that everything she's saying is worth hearing and everything she's showing is worth seeing.But by the middle, what seemed like confidence reveals itself as a bad combination of presumption and naivete. Writer-director Maryam Keshavarz clearly believed we'd willingly follow her down every alley and rabbit hole of plot and assumed we'd be as interested in her
