Downtown S.F.â€™s AI-powered smoothie bar is already closed
-----
A downtown San Francisco smoothie shop that offered drink recommendations based on an artificial intelligence prompt is now closed.BetterBlends, at 992 Market St., is no longer blending its "bespoke AI nutrition" drinks. On Tuesday morning, Oct. 31, only a few stools remained inside the shop, with no blending machines or fresh produce in sight. Founders Michael Parlato and Clayton Reynolds opened the shop this summer, seeking $1 million in funding and with hopes to develop their own app.
