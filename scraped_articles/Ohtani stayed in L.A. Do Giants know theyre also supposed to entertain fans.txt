Ohtani stayed in L.A. Do Giants know theyâ€™re also supposed to entertain fans?
-----
The Great Ohtani Dam has been removed from MLB free agency and the river of money has finally started flowing. Including from the coffers of the San Francisco Giants. The Giants were reported on Tuesday to be signing Korean star outfielder Jung Hoo Lee to a six-year, $113 million deal.So this is the beginning of the Giants Plan B.
Will the Giants be able to do enough to ensure there are more than six sellouts next season at Oracle Park? Right now the dates May 13-14-15 and June
