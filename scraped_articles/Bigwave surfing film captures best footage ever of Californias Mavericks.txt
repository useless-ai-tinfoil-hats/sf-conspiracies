Big-wave surfing film captures ‘best footage ever’ of California’s Mavericks
-----
The historic ocean swell that pulled surfers from around the world to Mavericks for a one-day big-wave surfing bonanza last week has been captured in a documentary film posted to YouTube and free to view."It's the best footage that's ever been captured" at the famous Half Moon Bay reef break, said Mavericks pioneer Jeff Clark.
On Dec. 28, weather and water conditions aligned to pump a train of estimated 50-foot titans through the notoriously fickle surf zone off of Pillar Point.
