Without warning, American Airlines raised its checked baggage fees overnight by as much as 33%, becoming the latest U.S. carrier to tap into this hated surcharge to cover rising costs elsewhere.For domestic U.S. flights, checked bag fees jumped from $30 to $35 if you purchase in advance through American's website or app.
For travelers who wait to check a bag in person at the airport, the fee increases from $30 to $40. The charge for a second checked bag is now $45, up from $40.
