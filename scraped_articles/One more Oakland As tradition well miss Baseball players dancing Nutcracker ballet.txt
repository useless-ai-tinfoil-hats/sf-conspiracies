One more Oakland A’s tradition we’ll miss: Baseball players dancing ‘Nutcracker’ ballet
-----
Oakland Athletics third baseman Carney Lansford in the 1980s routinely played high-leverage games in a stadium filled with 50,000 fans.But come December 1986, he was terrified to perform for a crowd of fewer than 3,000. The difference? He was making his debut as a ballet dancer in "The Nutcracker."
"We'll get some ribbing from the guys. That's all right," Lansford told the Chronicle. "We just don't want to make fools of ourselves, so we're taking this seriously."
