Gate crasher: What happened in the first hours of SF’s Outside Lands
-----
San Francisco's Outside Lands Music Festival got started on Friday with a heavy blanket of fog draped over Golden Gate Park and no sign of the sun making an appearance any time soon. Before the main gate opened at 10:45 a.m., the Polo Field was mostly empty of people except for some workers and Daði Freyr, the 6-foot-8-inch Icelandic dance-pop artist who took fourth place in Eurovision in 2021. He was roaming the grounds before his 2 p.m. set on the Sutro stage and I stopped to chat with him.
