Francine Prose's captivating new memoir focuses on her intense relationship with an impassioned peace activist, which began and ended within a few months a half-century ago, just as she was starting her career as a writer. With its fraught, late-night conversations about secrets and regret — most of which take place in a big American car hurtling down San Francisco's rain-slicked streets — "1974: A Personal History" often reads like a heady film noir set amid the ashes of '60s idealism.
