Tahoe's snow season likely to shrink dramatically this century, new report says
-----
The snow season at Lake Tahoe, which famously draws millions of skiers to the area's powdery slopes each year, is likely to shrink by at least a month, and perhaps three months, by the end of the century, according to a recent report on the impacts of climate change on the region.Temperatures around the lake, projected to rise as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, will simply be too warm at the beginning and end of the traditional ski season for the snow to fall, the report says.
