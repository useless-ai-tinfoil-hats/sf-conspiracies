An annular solar eclipse is coming. Here's how to (safely) watch it.
-----
There are two solar eclipses coming in the next few months. The events, which happen when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, partially obscuring the view of the sun from certain spots on Earth, are fairly uncommon. On Oct. 14, 2023, an annular eclipse will occur, partially blocking out the sun. On April 8, 2024, however, a total solar eclipse that's being referred to as the "Great North American Eclipse," will take place. Because April's eclipse is a total one, daylight will be blocked
