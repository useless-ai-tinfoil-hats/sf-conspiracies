S.F.’s ‘Winter of Love’ showed the LGBTQ community a brighter future
-----
When I heard that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom had begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of California and federal law on Feb. 12, 2004, I knew I had to witness history.That year, between Feb. 12 and March 11, the city performed weddings for approximately 4,000 same-sex couples before the California Supreme Court halted them and later ruled the marriages void. That month would later be dubbed San Francisco's "Winter of Love."
I was a 19-year-old
