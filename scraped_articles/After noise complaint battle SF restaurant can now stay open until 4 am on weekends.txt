After noise complaint battle, SF restaurant can now stay open until 4 am on weekends
-----
Following Bissap Baobab's triumph over last year's lengthy noise complaint battle, the San Francisco restaurant is going for a victory lap. On Tuesday, the San Francisco Entertainment Commission unanimously approved Bissap Baobab's request to stay open until 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, as first reported by Mission Local."When you step out at 9:30 or 10 p.m. sometimes on a Saturday and see that there's nobody, you are wondering what is happening," owner Marco Senghor told SFGATE.
