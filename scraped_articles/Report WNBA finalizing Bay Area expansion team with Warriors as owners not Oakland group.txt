Report: WNBA finalizing Bay Area expansion team with Warriors as owners, not Oakland group
-----
At long last, it seems like the Bay Area will get a WNBA team.The Athletic's Marcus Thompson reported Tuesday night that the Golden State Warriors "are close" to bringing a WNBA franchise to the Bay Area. A statement from the Warriors given to the San Francisco Chronicle said it is "premature" to say a deal was finalized, but both the Warriors and the WNBA acknowledged conversations have been ongoing. (The Chronicle and SFGATE are both owned by Hearst but have separate newsrooms.)
