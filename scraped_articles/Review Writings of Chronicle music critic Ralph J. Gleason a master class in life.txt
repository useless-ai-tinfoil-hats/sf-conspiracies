Review: Writings of Chronicle music critic Ralph J. Gleason a master class in life
-----
When the great bandleader Duke Ellington died in 1974, longtime Chronicle critic Ralph J. Gleason wrote a lengthy appreciation for Rolling Stone. Gleason, who began his career writing about jazz and popular music back in the 1930s, co-founded the countercultural magazine with Jann Wenner in 1967.Near the end of the piece, Gleason quoted French poet Blaise Cendrars, who once saw the Ellington orchestra perform in Europe: "Such music is not only a new art form but a new reason for living."
