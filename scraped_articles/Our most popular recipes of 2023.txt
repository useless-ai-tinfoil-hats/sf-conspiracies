It's been a year of delicious home cooking, thanks to weekly recipes from San Francisco Chronicle columnists Christian Reynoso and Amisha Gurbani.There were heirloom tomato tarts, smoky lamb tacos and fruity hand pies. But in the end, readers kept coming back to these 10 recipes. There were classic comforts like pasta — lots of pasta — and dishes that showed off seasonal favorites, from Dungeness crab to Sungold tomatoes. If you haven't cooked any of these recipes yet, now is the time.
