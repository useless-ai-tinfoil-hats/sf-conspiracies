Giants option Kai-Wei Teng, call up Sean Hjelle
-----
Kai-Wei Teng helped save the rest of the bullpen when the San Francisco Giants absorbed a 16-run loss Friday night, and his reward, as it so often is for long relievers, was to get optioned back to the minors.Teng worked an inning, faced nine batters and gave up five runs, pushing his ERA to 9.82. He'll get some starts at Triple-A Sacramento and has some things to work on, particularly limiting walks; he had eight in 11 innings (and also gave up 15 hits, giving him a WHIP of 2.09).
