Once again, 49ers QB Brock Purdy can't escape stray Mac Jones comparisons
-----
Before 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy can enter the conversation for MVP, as his teammates so desperately want, he'll have to escape the shadow of Mac Jones.If it sounds strange to compare a player who has yet to lose in the regular season, and is at the top of the league in nearly every statistical category, with a guy who was just benched for the second straight game this season, it's because the comparison is quite a leap. And yet, Jones and Purdy were mentioned in the same breath
