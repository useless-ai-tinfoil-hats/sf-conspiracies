‘Wow, this kid’s special’: 49ers’ Brock Purdy surprised his surgeon
-----
Dr. Keith Meister has a standard line he gives to patients, many of them professional pitchers, after surgically repairing their shoulder or elbow: "best one I've ever done."The words, delivered with a grin, are meant to break the post-procedure tension and quickly let the patient know that all went well. When it comes to Brock Purdy, however, it's fair to wonder: Was the surgery Meister performed on the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback March 10, quite literally Meister's finest work?
