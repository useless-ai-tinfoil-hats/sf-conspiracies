Handing down holiday traditions, one stocking at a time
-----
The stockings were hung by the chimney with careâ€¦This needs a little backstory. My mother, Nurse Vivian, had grown up in Johnstown, Penn., with the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition that on the Eve of St. Nicholas Day, Dec. 6, children would leave carrots in their shoes, and in the morning, they'd find that St. Nicholas had filled them with nuts and cookies. This was during the Depression, so a handful of pecans and sand tarts meant something.
