Oakland school district to host lessons about Palestine, superintendent objects
-----
A group of teachers from a Bay Area school district plan to host a pro-Palestinian classroom lesson event Wednesday, a move their superintendent said doesn't align with school standards.The curriculum, created by Oakland Unified School District teachers, has lessons for kindergarten through high school students on the lives of Palestinians in Gaza and its history. In a YouTube video posted Nov. 26, an unnamed teacher from the district urged educators across the district to participate.
