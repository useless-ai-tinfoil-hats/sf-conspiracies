San Francisco is bidding to host the Sundance Film Festival. That's a terrible idea.
-----
The Sundance Film Festival takes place in Park City, Utah, a ski town with a population of 8,374 located about an hour east of Salt Lake City. Arguably the most important film festival in the country, it's hard to get to, incredibly expensive to attend, and the icy locale means that attendees end up watching at least one movie wearing soaking wet socks. I know because I went this year, a fact that I casually drop into conversation whenever possible.Park City has been home to Sundance
