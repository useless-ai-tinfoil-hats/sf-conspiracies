A wide range of emotions for Aâ€™s as the end of a forgettable season nears
-----
Pride, gratitude and relief permeated the Oakland Athletics' clubhouse Sunday morning ahead of the A's matchup against Detroit, the final game at the Coliseum for 2023."It's always kind of a bittersweet moment when the season's over," A's rookie outfielder Lawrence Butler said. "It's been a long season."
A long season in terms of the record is undeniable. The A's dropped 50 of their first 62 games and entered Sunday at 48-107, one loss shy of the Oakland season record set in 1979.
