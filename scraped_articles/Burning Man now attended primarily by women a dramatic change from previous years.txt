Burning Man now attended primarily by women, a dramatic change from previous years
-----
When tens of thousands of Burning Man attendees gather in the Nevada desert this week to mingle, attend events and, of course, watch the titular burning of a wooden effigy known as the "Man," there's a chance that most of them will be women.That was the case at last year's event, when slightly more people who attended Burning Man identified as female than male â€” the first time for the event since at least 2013, according to a demographic survey conducted by organizers.
