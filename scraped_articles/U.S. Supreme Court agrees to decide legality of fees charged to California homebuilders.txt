-----
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether a California man's rights were violated when his county required him to pay a $23,000 traffic-impact fee before being allowed to build a single-family home.George Sheetz's case will determine how far a local government must go to show that fees charged for construction projects are needed to cover the costs that the construction is likely to cause. It could also affect the types of housing that cities and counties allow to be built.
