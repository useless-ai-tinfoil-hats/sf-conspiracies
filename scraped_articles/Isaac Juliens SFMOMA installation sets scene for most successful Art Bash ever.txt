Isaac Julienâ€™s SFMOMA installation sets scene for most successful Art Bash ever
-----
Entering Schwab Hall at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for Art Bash, there was a sense of luscious serenity.Amid British artist and filmmaker Isaac Julien's installation for the event's dinner on Wednesday, April 24, the ticket desks and museum store were swathed in blue fabric and adorned with the British-born artist's gloriously cinematic photography. It was like being inside one of the multiscreen film works Julien is acclaimed for.
