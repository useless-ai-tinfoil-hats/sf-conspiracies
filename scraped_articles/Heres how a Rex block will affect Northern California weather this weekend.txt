Here’s how a ‘Rex block’ will affect Northern California weather this weekend
-----
Not a cloud was in the sky across Northern California on Thursday, and sunshine will continue Friday and through the weekend.The only hazardous weather expected in the coming days is continued gusty north-northeast winds Friday. Gusts of 25-40 mph are possible through the early afternoon in the valleys and at the coast, possibly eclipsing 50 mph at the highest peaks. The breezy winds should be confined to the North Bay by Friday evening, eventually tapering off overnight.
