Just off I-58, Calif.'s only Indigenous barbecue restaurant draws crowds with fry bread tacos

"This place, it's a tiny hole in the wall that nobody's ever even heard of."Mano Lujan is half right. His restaurant, Red House BBQ in windswept Tehachapi, California, qualifies as a "hole in the wall" insomuch as the space is filled with the expected trinkets and photos, from old road signs to neon beer lights. But Lujan is wrong about the importance of Red House â€” not only for the local community but for the countless travelers exiting the highway for a road trip bite.
