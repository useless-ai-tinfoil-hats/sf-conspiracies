Noah Gabriel, 5, sits on a bean bag chair in the middle of a construction zone, completely unbothered by the chaos and noise around him. He has headphones, a fully charged iPad, a stuffed animal and plenty of snacks. He's not at school because he's sick, which meant tagging along with his dad to an industrial park on the edge of the Napa River where a wine tasting room is beginning to take shape.Noah's dad, Kyle Gabriel, is on his fourth attempt at sawing down a piece of baseboard.
