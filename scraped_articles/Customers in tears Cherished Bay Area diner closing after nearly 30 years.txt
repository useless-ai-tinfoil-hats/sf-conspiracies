'Customers in tears': Cherished Bay Area diner closing after nearly 30 years
-----
Mike's Diner Bar, a 29-year-old Palo Alto institution, was nearly evicted last year after the owner was one day late paying rent. Now, the restaurant is actually closing, with its last day of service slated for Father's Day, June 16."I've been in the business a long time â€” I started when I was at Palo Alto High School," owner Mike Wallau told SFGATE. "And I've just never seen the business so unforgiving. Since COVID, it seems if it's not one thing, it's another."
