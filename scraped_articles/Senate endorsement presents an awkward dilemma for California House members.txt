Senate endorsement presents an awkward dilemma for California House members
-----
Choosing a candidate to endorse typically isn't all that controversial for most California House members.Except in the upcoming U.S. Senate primary.
With three of their co-workers running — Reps. Barbara Lee of Oakland, Katie Porter of Irvine and Adam Schiff of Burbank — the lawmakers are in an awkward place. Whether or not they endorse, they risk the wrath of the next senator from California, either by picking one of their opponents or avoiding a strong position.
