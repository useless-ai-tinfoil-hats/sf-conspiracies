About 49ers QB Brock Purdy’s sneak: Don’t credit Jimmy G.
-----
INGLEWOOD — Brock Purdy's 1-yard quarterback sneak for a touchdown that tied the score as time expired in the first half was a huge play in the San Francisco 49ers' 30-23 win over the Rams on Sunday.But no credit belongs to former 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo, who was elite when it came to QB sneaks, for Purdy's successful conversion on 2nd-and-goal with one second left. Garoppolo was 31 of 32 converting sneaks for first downs in his 49ers' tenure.
