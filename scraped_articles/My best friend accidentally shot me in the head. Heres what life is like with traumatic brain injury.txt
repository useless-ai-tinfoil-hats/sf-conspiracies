My best friend accidentally shot me in the head. Hereâ€™s what life is like with traumatic brain injury
-----
On April 7, 2017, I was shot in the head by my best friend in our on-campus apartment, one month before college graduation. It was a freak accident. The bullet went through two walls before fracturing my skull, sending shards of bone into my brain. I required neurosurgery, titanium plates and screws.A traumatic brain injury is just that, an injury that traumatizes the brain, usually a result of a violent blow to the head. More than 5 million Americans are living with a brain injury.
