Tahoe bans alcohol at popular beaches for the Fourth of July
-----
Want to kick back with a beer on the beach at Lake Tahoe to celebrate the Fourth of July? It could cost you â€” and I mean way more than an overpriced Tahoe Deep IPA.Alcohol is banned at three of Lake Tahoe's most popular beaches for the forthcoming holiday. Officials banned alcohol at Nevada Beach and Zephyr Cove Resort, including Zephyr Shoals, on July Fourth. Public consumption is also banned at Chambers Landing in Tahoma for the entire holiday weekend, July 3-7.
Booze was banned
