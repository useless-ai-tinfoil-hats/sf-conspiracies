This wild race is Tahoe's version of Bay to Breakers
-----
If there can be a school of salmon swimming upstream in Bay to Breakers, then there can certainly be a bunch of racers in banana suits skiing uphill while chugging local craft brews in Lake Tahoe.Skiing uphill? In a costume? While downing an adult beverage? You bet it's real. You'll find Tahoe's version of Bay to Breakers this weekend in Incline Village at the fifth annual Luggi Foeger Uphill/Downhill Festival, hosted at Diamond Peak Ski Resort.
The race has grown in popularity
