The hard core and hungover honor St. Patrick’s Day with Rogue’s March the day after S.F.’s big parade
-----
Saturday's San Francisco St. Patrick's Day parade was just a five-hour warm-up for Kerry Egan. He saved his shamrock sport coat and shamrock shirt for the longer commitment required of St. Patrick's Day itself at the Lark Bar on Market Street."Feeling every bit of it today," Egan said as he stood outside the Irish pub shortly after noon, steadied by his wife, Jamie, and their 7-year-old freckle-faced son, Jameson. "You're going to get the 'hair of the dog' crowd."
On Saturday there
