Six-run rally pushes SHC past St. Ignatius, extends win streak to five
-----
Even though the Bruce-Mahoney Trophy had been secured months ago — landing at rival St. Ignatius — the Sacred Heart Cathedral baseball team had plenty to play for.Beating the Wildcats is always ultra satisfying for the Irish.
They did that for a second time in three weeks Tuesday with a 9-7 win at Marchbank Park, thanks to a six-run rally in the bottom of the sixth that included a two-run homer from Gianni Conte, a two-run double from Tobey Do and an RBI triple from Barclay Ovalle.
