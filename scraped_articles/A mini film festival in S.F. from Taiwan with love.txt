A mini film festival in S.F. from Taiwan, with love

Watching Chinese-language films, just days after their release in Asia, at his father's movie theater in San Francisco's Chinatown are some of Frank Lee's most treasured memories.Take "Execution in Autumn," a 1972 action drama about a woman determined to save her grandson from a death sentence. Made by Lee Hsing, who is considered by many to be the godfather of Taiwanese cinema, it's a film that captivated a young Lee when he saw it at the long-defunct Bella Union on Kearny Street.
