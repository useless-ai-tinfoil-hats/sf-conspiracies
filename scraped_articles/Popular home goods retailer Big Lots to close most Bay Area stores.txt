-----
Discount home goods and furniture retailer Big Lots is closing at least 13 stores in and around the Bay Area and dozens more across the state of California in the wake of declining sales and "substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue," according to its May regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The filing initially stated plans for Big Lots to close 35 to 40 stores and open three others in 2024 but did not specify which locations would shutter.
