The Waikiki dinner party where Hawaii's Miss Universe graces the stage
-----
Every night, as the sun begins to set in Waikiki, a crowd gathers to watch a unique Hawaii hula tradition on the oceanfront lawn at the Halekulani hotel, with a clear view of Leahi (aka Diamond Head) in the distance.Beautifully dressed in aloha attire, with long lei draped around her neck and a large pua (flower) adorned in her hair, Brook Mahealani Lee captures the audience's attention as she sways to a melody played by the Hawaiian musicians behind her.
Lee is not just any hula
