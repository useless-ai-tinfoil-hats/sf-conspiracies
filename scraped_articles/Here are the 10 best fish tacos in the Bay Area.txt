Here are the 10 best fish tacos in the Bay Area
-----
My ideal afterlife must serve golden brown, beer-battered fish tacos, preferably near an Ensenada beach in Mexico. The dish is a podium for crunch, a result from the chemical reaction that occurs when a carbonated batter meets scalding hot oil.I've never had to search hard for excellent seafood in the Bay Area but finding a good Baja fish taco was a challenge. For a while, it felt like I had a better chance of spotting Sasquatch â€¦ until I actually started researching. Boy, was I wrong!
