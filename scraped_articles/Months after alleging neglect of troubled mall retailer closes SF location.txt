Months after alleging 'neglect' of troubled mall, retailer closes SF location
-----
Clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters is permanently closing its doors in San Francisco, after filing a lawsuit last year against the former owners of the downtown mall, previously known as Westfield San Francisco Centre. The suit alleges that the ownership group's mismanagement exposed the store and its employees to "rampant criminal activity."The store is slated to close on July 12, according to a WARN notice the company filed on Monday, and all 52 employees will lose their jobs.
