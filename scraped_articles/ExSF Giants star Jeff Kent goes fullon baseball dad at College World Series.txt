Ex-SF Giants star Jeff Kent goes full-on 'baseball dad' at College World Series
-----
For the first time in a long time, ex-San Francisco Giants star Jeff Kent has been a topic of major conversation on ESPN again â€” this time, though, it's not for anything he's doing on the diamond. It's for his son, Kaeden. Kaeden Kent is a second baseman (like his dad) at Texas A&M, which enters the deciding game of the Men's College World Series' best-of-three series Monday against Tennessee, and his former MVP dad got plenty of airtime from ESPN during this past weekend's coverage.
