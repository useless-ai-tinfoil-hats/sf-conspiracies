The secret is out about this unassuming California strawberry stand
-----
Kim Tucker may be one of the luckiest people in California, especially this time of year.Tucker lives about a half mile from Phan's Strawberries, a small fruit and vegetable stand on the corner of Walnut and North Mariposa avenues, just about a 10-minute drive east from downtown Visalia.
The unassuming stand consists of four whitewashed walls, a large cut-out window and a little area in the back, where owner Chai Saephan is busy boiling water for lunch on a recent weekday
