San Francisco Giants owner donates $5,000 to help stop critical race theory in schools
-----
San Francisco Giants principal owner Charles B. Johnson recently donated $5,000 to a political action committee that encourages people to report schools "promoting critical race theory."New electronic filings from the Federal Election Commission show that Johnson, who has a history of donating to right-wing candidates and causes, made his donation to the Project 1776 PAC on Nov. 21 of last year. The donation was first reported on social media by former SFGATE politics editor Alex Shultz.
