Magic Mountain's line-cutting app works almost too well

You've heard the story of opening day at Disneyland: The asphalt was still so fresh on Main Street USA that heels sunk into it. Oh, and a Southern California heat wave caused the mercury to inch past 100 degrees, making the whole thing a sweltering and truncated affair.It wasn't quite the same one-disaster-after-another trip to Magic Mountain for my 9-year-old son and me on a midsummer weekday trip, with the exception of one thing: the heat.
The sweltering day on the northern edge
