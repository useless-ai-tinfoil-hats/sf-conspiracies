Bay Area weather might ruin solar eclipse views. Hereâ€™s what to expect
-----
A solar eclipse is coming to the Western United States this weekend, but unsettled weather may obscure the celestial event for many Californians.The "ring of fire" eclipse begins at 8 a.m. Saturday and will reach its maximum between 9:15 a.m. and 9:25 a.m., when the moon will obscure the view of the sun except for its outer edge, or annulus. Full annularity will be visible along a thin path on the Earth's surface stretching from Oregon to Brazil.
