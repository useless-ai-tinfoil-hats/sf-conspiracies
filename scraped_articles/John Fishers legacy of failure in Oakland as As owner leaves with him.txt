John Fisher’s legacy of failure in Oakland as A’s owner leaves with him
-----
John Fisher, owner of the Oakland Athletics, will not be getting his cleaning deposit back. Not after the mess he has made of what was once a perfectly good baseball team.Fisher will, however, be allowed to take with him the several acres of dusty green tarp with which he covered the seats in the Coliseum's upper deck and Mount Davis, back in 2006, his first season as A's owner.
At last, the Coliseum's rats and possums will be able to get some sunshine.
It would be impossible
