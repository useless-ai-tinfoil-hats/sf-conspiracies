Chaos reigns at infamous San Francisco rock band's live show
-----
56-year-old Anton Newcombe does not like taking orders from his audience."I don't go to Dunkin' Donuts and tell you what to do, motherfâ€”ker," he hisses into the microphone. Aging hippie revivalists in the crowd cheer while his six other bandmates stand behind him, politely taking swigs of wine from the bottle. I'm at the Warfield watching The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and the audience, it seems, finally got what it wanted.
Formed in San Francisco in 1990, BJM is a seven-piece
