Homeless man not guilty of assaulting ex-fire commissioner after bear-spray defense
-----
A San Francisco jury ruled Friday that a homeless man who struck a former city fire commissioner with a metal pipe was not guilty, siding with defense attorneys who argued he acted in self-defense after he and other unhoused people were doused with bear spray.Garret Doty, 25, faced two counts of assault and one count of battery in a case that rippled across the city at a time of rising tension over tent encampments and how city officials — and occasionally vigilantes — respond to them.
