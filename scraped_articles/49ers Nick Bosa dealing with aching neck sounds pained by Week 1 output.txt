49ersâ€™ Nick Bosa, dealing with aching neck, sounds pained by Week 1 output
-----
How does it feel after playing 35 snaps in an NFL game shortly after ending a 43-day contract holdout?Nick Bosa's answer wasn't surprising.
"Yeah," he said, "I was sore."
The San Francisco 49ers' All-Pro pass rusher was still dealing with an aching neck Wednesday, but otherwise declared himself pain-free after playing in Sunday's 30-7 season-opening win at Pittsburgh three days after participating in his first practice since June.
