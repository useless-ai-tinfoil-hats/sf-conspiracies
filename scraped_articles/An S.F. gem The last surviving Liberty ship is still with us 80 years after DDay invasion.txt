An S.F. gem: The last surviving Liberty ship is still with us, 80 years after D-Day invasion
-----
This coming Thursday is the 80th anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1944, when thousands of troops landed on the French beaches in Normandy, a turning point of World War II.The invasion was supported by a huge armada of ships â€” perhaps the largest ever assembled. There were mighty battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, troopships, cargo vessels. The invasion was "the most complex and daring military operation in the history of modern warfare," historian Carlo D'Este wrote.
