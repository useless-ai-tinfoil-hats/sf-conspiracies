Destroyed Bay Area home with only a pool left hits market for $2 million
-----
A Sonoma County property that's been on the market for several months is garnering some online attention this week thanks to photos of what is currently its one and only feature: a pool.The small ranch-style home that once stood at 10547 Chalk Hill Road in Healdsburg burned down in the 2019 Kincade Fire, listing agent Tatiana McWilliams told SFGATE. Now, all that remains is its crystal-blue infinity pool overlooking Mount Saint Helena. The 5-acre property is listed for $1.995 million.
