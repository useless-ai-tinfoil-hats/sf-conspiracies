Letters: Kids don’t always talk to their parents about gender identity. Why that’s OK
-----
I am the parent of a transgender child who is now a young adult. I consider myself an open and supportive dad, but my firstborn, Jude, could not bring themselves to raise their gender identity with me.We had those awkward talks about drugs and birth control, but each time I was told, "Hey Dad, I already heard all this stuff in middle school."
We didn't talk about gender identity, and it wasn't until Jude entered their first year of college that I got word that they were nonbinary
