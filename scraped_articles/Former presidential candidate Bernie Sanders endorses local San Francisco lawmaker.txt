Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston in his reelection bid for his District 5 seat, making Preston just one of five candidates nationwide that the two-time presidential candidate threw his official support behind on Tuesday."We need leaders like Dean Preston in every state, at all levels of government â€” leaders who not only stand up to special interests, but also have the courage to address striking levels of inequality at their core," Sanders said
