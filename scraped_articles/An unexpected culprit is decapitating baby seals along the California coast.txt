An unexpected culprit is decapitating baby seals along the California coast
-----
Earlier this spring, researchers discovered a grisly scene in the sand at MacKerricher State Park near Fort Bragg in Northern California.Ice plants spattered with blood indicated there had been some kind of a scuffle just a few feet away from the crashing waves. Though paw prints still covered the beach, the unknown predator was long gone. What remained was the carcass of a harbor seal pup, its head completely gnawed off.
"It's somewhat gruesome," said Frankie Gerraty, a Ph.D.
