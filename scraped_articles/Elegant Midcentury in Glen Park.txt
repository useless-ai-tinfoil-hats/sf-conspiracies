(ad) The sellers of 35 Hiliritas Ave. in Glen Park wrote the following narrative about their experience with the property:When we first discovered 35 Hiliritas Ave. during an open house tour, we knew it had the potential to be our forever home. Nestled high on the hill of Glen Park, offering breathtaking vistas for miles, this property called to us despite its initial rough state. We envisioned transforming it into a luxurious sanctuary and immediately knew it was the right choice.
