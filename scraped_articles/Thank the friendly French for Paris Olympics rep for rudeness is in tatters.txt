PARIS â€” Stuck on a metro train coming back from track was not the ideal place to be while the U.S. men's basketball team was in a thriller against Serbia.Thankfully the French guy to my right, whose face was painted in the tricolor, had the game on his phone. When he saw me sneaking glimpses at his screen, he pivoted the phone toward me and shared the viewing excitement. Merci!
Stephen Curry saved the U.S. men. Monsieur iPhone saved me.
