An accomplished woodworker and general contractor, the Oakland man earned accolades for rebuilding Berkeley's famed Chez Panisse restaurant after a fire and constructing a conference center at then-Mills College. He was, he said, enjoying a full life."I'm a bachelor with girlfriends, I had a lot of high-quality, high-intensity work, I was a musician writing songs, I was a photographer. I was living my best life at 76," he said.
