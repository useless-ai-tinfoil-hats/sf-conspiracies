Quarantined at Tokyo Olympics, S.F. fencer Massialas seeks redemption in Paris
-----
Ask any athlete who was there to describe the Tokyo Olympics, and they will inevitably use words like "strange," "weird," "bizarre."Delayed for a year due to the pandemic and played out in empty stadiums in a quiet city, with athletes sequestered in the village and undergoing maniacal testing protocols, it was indeed strange. But for a handful of athletes, it was more than strange. It was devastating.
Alexander Massialas, a decorated fencer from San Francisco and former Stanford
