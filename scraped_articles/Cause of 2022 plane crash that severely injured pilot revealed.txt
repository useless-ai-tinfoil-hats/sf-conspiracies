Santa Clara County officials said Wednesday that a 2022 plane crash in San Jose was caused by pilot error, citing a report by the National Transportation Safety Board.Inadequate preflight inspection and poor fuel management caused the single-engine plane to lose power shortly after takeoff, spokespersons for the county said.
The plane had 15 gallons of fuel available in one of its two tanks, but the pilot was using another tank that had been depleted, the spokespersons said.
