Are 49ers poised for a 4-0 run? Kyle Shanahan definitely not going there
-----
The San Francisco 49ers didn't register their fourth win of the season until 10 days before Thanksgiving in 2021, and not until the day before Halloween in 2022.In 2023? They're a good bet to reach that victory total before it even begins to feel like fall.
*  Mike Silver: Brock Purdy not perfect (yet), but 49ers finding out he's the baller they needed
After wretched starts in back-to-back seasons, the 49ers might be poised to open 4-0 for just the third time in the past 33
