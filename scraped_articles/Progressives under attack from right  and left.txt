Progressives under attack from right â€” and left
-----
Conservatives are once again successfully demonizing and devaluing a term embraced by liberals, and this time they are doing it with the help of Democrats.Even in purportedly liberal bastions like San Francisco and Oakland, the word "progressive" is being twisted to denote radical ideas and inept leadership instead of hope and revolutionary change.
Republicans and many moderate Democrats have perpetuated a distorted narrative around progressivism, and any term associated with it.
