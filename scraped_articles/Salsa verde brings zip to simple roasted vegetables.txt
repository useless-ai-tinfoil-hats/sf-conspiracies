Salsa verde brings zip to simple roasted vegetables
-----
One vegetable my kids thoroughly enjoy is broccolini. More slender than regular broccoli, broccolini has smaller florets and long stalks that crisp up nicely in the oven. I like to roast it with olive, salt and pepper, and garnish with a squeeze of lemon and lots of freshly shaved Parmesan. The kids chow it down within minutes. Now that's the way to a mother's heart!I am celebrating broccolini and radishes in today's recipe, Roasted Broccolini and Radish with Salsa Verde.
