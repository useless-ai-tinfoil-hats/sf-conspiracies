Lucy Rushton, MLS trailblazer and Bay FC GM, embraces expansion ‘adventure’
-----
Lucy Rushton makes a point to go to downtown Los Altos coffee shops and restaurants for team meetings. One, Cafe Nur, has become the Bay FC front office's de facto gathering place.At some point, she'll venture beyond her new home and the PayPal Park offices to experience more of the Bay Area, perhaps next year when her family visits. Until then, a trip to the town square is the closest Rushton has found to life outside of Bay FC.
The team's first general manager knows the routine
