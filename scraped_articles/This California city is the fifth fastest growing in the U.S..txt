This California city is the fifth fastest growing in the U.S.
-----
Double the people, double the housing.That's just what happened to Lathrop, a suburban city about 10 miles south of Stockton, over the last decade. Its population rose from just over 19,000 in 2013 to nearly 40,000 in 2023, according to estimates released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. That boom of residents included an increase of about 4,800 people from 2022 to 2023, a 14% rise that made Lathrop the nation's fifth-fastest growing city with at least 20,000 people.
