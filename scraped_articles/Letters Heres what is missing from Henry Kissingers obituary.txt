Letters: Here’s what is missing from Henry Kissinger’s obituary
-----
Regarding "Diplomat won fame for work on China, Vietnam: Statesman's influence lasted long past '70s" (Page One, Dec. 1): Rather than choose the Associated Press' off-the-shelf laudatory obituary on Henry Kissinger, the Chronicle should have printed Rolling Stone's article, "Good Riddance: Henry Kissinger, War Criminal Beloved by America's Ruling Class, Finally Dies."It would have better suited the politics of the Bay Area and been consistent with the tone of Jack Ohman's Dec. 1
