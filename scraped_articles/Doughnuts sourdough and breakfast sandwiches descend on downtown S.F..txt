Breakfast sandwiches, African food and vegan doughnuts are coming to downtown San Francisco.Local bakeries, restaurants and coffee shops will debut as part of the city's new Vacant to Vibrant program, which aims to revitalize the neighborhood by bringing pop-ups to empty storefronts. Most of the 17 pop-ups, including art, a flea market and a radio station, are slated to open by Monday, Oct. 2. They'll last for three months, with the potential to extend their temporary leases.
