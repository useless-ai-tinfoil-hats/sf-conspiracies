UC says no to a new campus in downtown San Francisco
-----
The University of California gave San Francisco disappointing news this week: It will not open a campus in the city's flagging downtown.A new school would be too expensive, UC said.
"Given the outlook for state appropriations and the financial capacity of our campuses, the university is not considering establishing any new campuses or other new facilities in the City of San Francisco at this time," Ryan King, a UC spokesperson, told the Chronicle this past week.
