Chance for rain returns to Bay Area weather forecast
-----
It's back: Rain returns to the San Francisco Bay Area weather forecast. A cold front is expected to bring chances of rain Friday into Saturday, but you may not even need an umbrella as the showers are likely to be light, forecasters said."This is what we expect at this time of year and as we go through October," said Brayden Murdock, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office in Monterey. "It's not unusual for us to see something this light early in the season."
