El Búho, "Strata" (Wonderwheel Recordings)
The moniker of British-born Robin Perkins, El Búho is the vessel for Perkins' unique blend of traditional Latin American music and natural sounds of the environment with electronic production. "Strata," out Friday, Nov. 3, is brimming with cumbia flutes, fluttering alongside chilled-out beats and vocals from singers like Bomba Estéreo's Li Saumet on the lead single, "Brujería."
