The Bay Area’s latest impossible-to-get wine comes from a country I never expected
-----
While I was having dinner recently at Kitchen Istanbul in San Francisco, wine director Joseph DiGrigoli was opening a bottle and asked me and my friends if we'd like a taste of it — blind. He brought it over in a decanter so that we couldn't see the label. It tasted like Pinot Noir: relatively light in body, bright in acidity, reminiscent of cranberries and mushrooms, with a distinct pine-needle aroma. One of my friends thought it was from the Sonoma Coast. Another posited New Zealand.
