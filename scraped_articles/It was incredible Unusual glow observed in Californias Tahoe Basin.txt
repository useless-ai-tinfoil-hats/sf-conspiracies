'It was incredible': Unusual glow observed in California's Tahoe Basin
-----
Michael Kennedy was watching the sunrise from his home in California's Olympic Valley near the Palisades Tahoe ski resort on Dec. 13, when he saw a spectacular glow rising above the mountain."I'm sitting at my desk and my desk faces the post office in Olympic Valley and to the right of me on the mountain the sun was coming up and bursting a beam of light," he told SFGATE over the phone. "This beam of light went straight up and formed into a fountain, like a funnel."
