Aâ€™s offense awakens in time to avoid losing series to woeful White Sox
-----
Oakland A's second baseman Zack Gelof eyed Darell Hernaiz batting as Gelof inched toward second base in the seventh inning Wednesday.Gelof said he figured Hernaiz would put the ball in play with two strikes, so he readied to run when Hernaiz bit at a 85 mph sweeper.
"My thought was, 'Get a big secondary (lead) and as soon as I see his hands go, just take off,''' Gelof said. "Obviously, it's a double-play situation, so it ended up working out great."
That planning allowed
