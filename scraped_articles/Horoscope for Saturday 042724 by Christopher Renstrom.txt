Horoscope for Saturday, 04/27/24 by Christopher Renstrom
-----
ARIES (March 19 - April 18): You barely step up to the plate and your leadership is questioned. This isn't about proving yourself; it's about building confidence.TAURUS (April 19 - May 19): Don't blame others for saying "no" because they want to stay in their comfort zone. You would have done the same in their shoes.
GEMINI (May 20 - June 19): Once again you and a loved one travel down different roads, but this is good. You need a little separateness in your togetherness to grow.
