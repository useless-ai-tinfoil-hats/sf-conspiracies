S.F. is losing one of its best taquerias
-----
One of San Francisco's best taquerias will close this weekend.Copas, known for its coal-grilled meats, will close on Saturday, April 20, after opening in late 2021 in the Castro. Operating the restaurant has become too expensive, spokeswoman Victoria Levi Wooley told the Chronicle, with large increases in costs like ingredients and labor. Business was good, boosted by favorable reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations, but never got to a level where it could sustain the restaurant.
